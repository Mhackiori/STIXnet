FIN7 is a financially-motivated threat group that has been active since 2013 primarily targeting the U.S. retail, restaurant, and hospitality sectors, often using point-of-sale malware. A portion of FIN7 was run out of a front company called Combi Security. Since 2020 FIN7 shifted operations to a big game hunting (BGH) approach including use of REvil ransomware and their own Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), Darkside. FIN7 may be linked to the Carbanak Group, but there appears to be several groups using Carbanak malware and are therefore tracked separately. FIN7 has registered look-alike domains for use in phishing campaigns. FIN7 has performed C2 using DNS via A, OPT, and TXT records. FIN7 malware has created Registry Run and RunOnce keys to establish persistence, and has also added items to the Startup folder. FIN7 used SQL scripts to help perform tasks on the victim's machine. FIN7 used a PowerShell script to launch shellcode that retrieved an additional payload. FIN7 used the command prompt to launch commands on the victimâ€™s machine. FIN7 used VBS scripts to help perform tasks on the victim's machine. FIN7 used JavaScript scripts to help perform tasks on the victim's machine. FIN7 created new Windows services and added them to the startup directories for persistence. FIN7 has encrypted virtual disk volumes on ESXi servers using a version of Darkside ransomware. FIN7 has collected files and other sensitive information from a compromised network. FIN7 has developed malware for use in operations, including the creation of infected removable media.
