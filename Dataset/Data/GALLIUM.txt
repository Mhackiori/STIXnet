GALLIUM is a group that has been active since at least 2012, primarily targeting high-profile telecommunications networks. GALLIUM has been identified in some reporting as likely a Chinese state-sponsored group, based in part on tools used and TTPs commonly associated with Chinese threat actors. GALLIUM has used Taiwan-based servers that appear to be exclusive to GALLIUM. GALLIUM used WinRAR to compress and encrypt stolen data prior to exfiltration. GALLIUM used PowerShell for execution to assist in lateral movement as well as for dumping credentials stored on compromised machines. GALLIUM used the Windows command shell to execute commands. GALLIUM created high-privileged domain user accounts to maintain access to victim networks. GALLIUM collected data from the victim's local system, including password hashes from the SAM hive in the Registry. GALLIUM compressed and staged files in multi-part archives in the Recycle Bin prior to exfiltration. GALLIUM used Web shells and HTRAN for C2 and to exfiltrate data. GALLIUM exploited a publicly-facing servers including Wildfly/JBoss servers to gain access to the network. GALLIUM used DLL side-loading to covertly load PoisonIvy into memory on the victim machine. GALLIUM has used PsExec to move laterally between hosts in the target network.
