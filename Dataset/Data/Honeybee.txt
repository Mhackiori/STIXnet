Honeybee is a campaign led by an unknown actor that targets humanitarian aid organizations and has been active in Vietnam, Singapore, Argentina, Japan, Indonesia, and Canada. Honeybee has been an active operation since August of 2017 and as recently as February 2018. Honeybee uses a combination of NTWDBLIB.dll and cliconfg.exe to bypass UAC protections using DLL hijacking. Honeybee uses FTP for command and control. Honeybee embeds a Visual Basic script within a malicious Word document as part of initial access; the script is executed when the Word document is opened. Honeybee has batch files that modify the system service COMSysApp to load a malicious DLL. Honeybee uses a dropper called MaoCheng that harvests a stolen digital signature from Adobe Systems. Honeybee gathers computer name and information using the systeminfo command.
