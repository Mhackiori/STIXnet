Environment Property Returns the WshEnvironment object (a collection of environment variables). object.Environment ([strType]) Arguments object WshShell object. strType Optional. Specifies the location of the environment variable. Remarks The Environment property contains the WshEnvironment object (a collection of environment variables). If strType is supplied, it specifies where the environment variable resides with possible values of System, User, Volatile, or Process. If strType is not supplied, the Environment property returns different environment variable types depending on the operating system. Type of Environment Variable Operating System System Microsoft Windows NT/2000 Process Windows 95/98/Me Note For Windows95/98/Me, only one strType is permitted â€” Process. The following table lists some of the variables that are provided with the Windows operating system. Scripts can access environment variables that have been set by other applications. Note None of the following variables are available from the Volatile type. Name Description System User Process (NT/ 2000) Process (98/ME) NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS Number of processors running on the machine. X - X - PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE Processor type of the user's workstation. X - X - PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER Processor ID of the user's workstation. X - X - PROCESSOR_LEVEL Processor level of the user's workstation. X - X - PROCESSOR_REVISION Processor version of the user's workstation. X - X - OS Operating system on the user's workstation. X - X - COMSPEC Executable file for the command prompt (typically cmd.exe). X - X X HOMEDRIVE Primary local drive (typically the C drive). - - X - HOMEPATH Default directory for users (typically \users\default in Windows 2000). - - X - PATH PATH environment variable. X X X X PATHEXT Extensions for executable files (typically .com, .exe, .bat, or .cmd). X - X - PROMPT Command prompt (typically $P$G). - - X X SYSTEMDRIVE Local drive on which the system directory resides (typically c:\). - - X - SYSTEMROOT System directory (for example, c:\winnt). This is the same as WINDIR. - - X - WINDIR System directory (for example, c:\winnt). This is the same as SYSTEMROOT. X - X X TEMP Directory for storing temporary files (for example, c:\temp). - X X X TMP Directory for storing temporary files (for example, c:\temp). - X X X Example The following code retrieves the system environment variable NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS. Set WshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell") Set WshSysEnv = WshShell.Environment("SYSTEM") WScript.Echo WshSysEnv("NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS") var WshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell"); var WshSysEnv = WshShell.Environment("SYSTEM"); WScript.Echo(WshSysEnv("NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS"));
