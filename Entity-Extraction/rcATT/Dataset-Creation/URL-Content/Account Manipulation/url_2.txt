Windows Security Log Event ID 4670 4670: Permissions on an object were changed On this page Windows logs this event when someone changes the access control list on an object. The event identifies the object, who changed the permissions and the old an new permissions. Of course the object's audit policy must have auditing enabled for "Write DAC"/"Change Permissions" or "Take Ownership" permissions for the user who just modified this object's access control list or a group to which the user belongs. Also, this event is logged based on the status of the Object Access subcategory - not the status of "Authorization Policy Change" subcategory. For instance to log this event for file permission changes, the "File System" subcategory must be enabled for success. Note the following problem is fixed in more recent versions of Windows. Definitely in Windows 8/2012. Not sure about Win7 and Win2008R2: This event has been observed as above after deleting an access control entry from the file's ACL. However the event was not logged after simply blocking permission inheritance and copying existing ACEs. Evidently this event is only logged when the effective permissions are changed not inheritance settings. This event is NOT logged when Active Directory object permissions are changed.
