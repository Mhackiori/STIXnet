MimiPenguin 2.0MimiPenguin 2.0 A tool to dump the login password from the current linux desktop user. Adapted from the idea behind the popular Windows tool mimikatz. This was assigned CVE-2018-20781 (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20781). Fun fact it's still not fixed after GNOME Keyring 3.27.2 and still works as of 3.28.0.2-1ubuntu1.18.04.1. DetailsDetails Takes advantage of cleartext credentials in memory by dumping the process and extracting lines that have a high probability of containing cleartext passwords. Will attempt to calculate each word's probability by checking hashes in /etc/shadow, hashes in memory, and regex searches. 2.0 introduces a clean C port that aims to increase the speed of execution and portability Known IssuesKnown Issues - The 32bit variant of mimipenguin (C build) may fail in a 64bit userspace as it currently does not adequatley handle searching a 64bit address space RequiresRequires - root permissions Supported/Tested SystemsSupported/Tested Systems - Kali 4.3.0 (rolling) x64 (gdm3) - Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 LTS x64 (Gnome Keyring 3.18.3-0ubuntu2) - Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.1 LTS x64 (Gnome Keyring 3.10.1-1ubuntu4.3, LightDM 1.10.6-0ubuntu1) - Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS x64 (Gnome Keyring 3.18.3-0ubuntu2) - Ubuntu Desktop 16.04.4 LTS x64 (Gnome Keyring 3.18.3-0ubuntu2, LightDM 1.18.3-0ubuntu1.1) - Ubuntu 18 - XUbuntu Desktop 16.04 x64 (Gnome Keyring 3.18.3-0ubuntu2) - Archlinux x64 Gnome 3 (Gnome Keyring 3.20) - OpenSUSE Leap 42.2 x64 (Gnome Keyring 3.20) - VSFTPd 3.0.3-8+b1 (Active FTP client connections) - Apache2 2.4.25-3 (Active/Old HTTP BASIC AUTH Sessions) [Gcore dependency] - openssh-server 1:7.3p1-1 (Active SSH connections - sudo usage) BuildingBuilding - To Build the C variant release simply run makein the root directory of the project - To build a debug binary with debug prints run make debug - To build a static linked binaries run make static NotesNotes - Password moves in memory - still honing in on 100% effectiveness - Plan on expanding support and other credential locations - Working on expanding to non-desktop environments - Known bug - sometimes gcore hangs the script, this is a problem with gcore - Open to pull requests and community research - LDAP research (nscld winbind etc) planned for future Development RoadmapDevelopment Roadmap - Implement needles in C port (speed up) - Add optional arg to target specific users only (speed up) MimiPenguin is slowly being ported to multiple languages to support all possible post-exploit scenarios. The roadmap below was suggested by KINGSABRI to track the various versions and features. An "X" denotes full support while a "~" denotes a feature with known bugs. |Feature||.sh||.py| |GDM password (Kali Desktop, Debian Desktop)||~||X| |Gnome Keyring (Ubuntu Desktop, ArchLinux Desktop)||~||X| |LightDM (Ubuntu Desktop)||X||X| |VSFTPd (Active FTP Connections)||X||X| |Apache2 (Active HTTP Basic Auth Sessions)||~||~| |OpenSSH (Active SSH Sessions - Sudo Usage)||~||~| ContactContact - Twitter: @huntergregal - Website: huntergregal.com - Github: huntergregal LicenceLicence CC BY 4.0 licence - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Special ThanksSpecial Thanks - the-useless-one for remove Gcore as a dependency, cleaning up tabs, adding output option, and a full python3 port - gentilkiwi for Mimikatz, the inspiration and the twitter shoutout - pugilist for cleaning up PID extraction and testing - ianmiell for cleaning up some of my messy code - w0rm for identifying printf error when special chars are involved - benichmt1 for identifying multiple authenticate users issue - ChaitanyaHaritash for identifying special char edge case issues - ImAWizardLizard for cleaning up the pattern matches with a for loop - coreb1t for python3 checks, arch support, other fixes - n1nj4sec for a python2 port and support - KINGSABRI for the Roadmap proposal - bourgouinadrien for linking https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck - bcoles for adding more needles and work on a metasploit module ruby port
