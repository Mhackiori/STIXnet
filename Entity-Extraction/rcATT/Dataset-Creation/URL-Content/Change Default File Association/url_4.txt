assoc Displays or modifies file name extension associations. If used without parameters, assoc displays a list of all the current file name extension associations. Note This command is only supported within cmd.exe and is not available from PowerShell. Though you can use cmd /c assoc as a workaround. Syntax assoc [<.[ext]>[=[<filetype>]]] Parameters |Parameter||Description| |Specifies the file name extension.| |Specifies the file type to associate with the specified file name extension.| |/?||Displays help at the command prompt.| Remarks To make changes in associations, you need administrator privileges. To remove the file type association for a file name extension, add a white space after the equal sign by pressing the SPACEBAR. To associate files without extension to a file type, use just a dot (see the examples). To view current file types that have open command strings defined, use the ftype command. To redirect the output of assoc to a text file, use the Examples To view the current file type association for the file name extension .txt, type: assoc .txt To remove the file type association for the file name extension .bak, type: assoc .bak= Note Make sure you add a space after the equal sign.
