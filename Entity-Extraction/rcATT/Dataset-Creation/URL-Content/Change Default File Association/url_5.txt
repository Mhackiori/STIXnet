Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 This Trojan arrives on a system as a file dropped by other malware or as a file downloaded unknowingly by users when visiting malicious sites. It employs registry shell spawning by adding certain registry entries. This allows this malware to execute even when other applications are opened. It modifies registry entries to disable the Windows Firewall settings. This action allows this malware to perform its routines without being deteted by the Windows Firewall. It creates certain registry entries to disable applications related to security. It deletes itself after execution. It displays fake alerts that warn users of infection. It also displays fake scanning results of the affected system. It then asks for users to purchase it once scanning is completed. If users decide to purchase the rogue product, users are directed to a certain website asking for sensitive information, such as credit card numbers.
