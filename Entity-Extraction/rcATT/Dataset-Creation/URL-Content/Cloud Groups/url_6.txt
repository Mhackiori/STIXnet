GetBucketAcl This implementation of the GET action uses the acl subresource to return the access control list (ACL) of a bucket. To use GET to return the ACL of the bucket, you must have READ_ACP access to the bucket. If READ_ACP permission is granted to the anonymous user, you can return the ACL of the bucket without using an authorization header. If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, requests to read ACLs are still supported and return the bucket-owner-full-control ACL with the owner being the account that created the bucket. For more information, see Controlling object ownership and disabling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
