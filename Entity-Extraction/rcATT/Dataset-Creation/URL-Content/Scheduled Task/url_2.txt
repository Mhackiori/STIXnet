Hi Daniel, The options vary log to log basis, for this one, you need to do it using size. Keep track for few weeks and you would know the exact size required to keep 7days data. Your 1MB setting would mean, someone is worried on the disk space, so be careful, you should start small, make it 100MB and see how much it retains.
