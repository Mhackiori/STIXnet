Note: You are viewing the documentation for an older major version of the AWS CLI (version 1). AWS CLI version 2, the latest major version of AWS CLI, is now stable and recommended for general use.

[ aws . iam ] Lists the IAM users that have the specified path prefix. If no path prefix is specified, the operation returns all users in the Amazon Web Services account. If there are none, the operation returns an empty list. Note IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for a user, see GetUser . You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters. See also: AWS API Documentation See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters. list-users is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument. When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: Users list-users [--path-prefix <value>] [--max-items <value>] [--cli-input-json <value>] [--starting-token <value>] [--page-size <value>] [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>] --path-prefix (string) The path prefix for filtering the results. For example: /division_abc/subdivision_xyz/ , which would get all user names whose path starts with /division_abc/subdivision_xyz/ . This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all user names. This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL character (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters. --max-items (integer) The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI. For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide . --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. --starting-token (string) A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response. For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide . --page-size (integer) The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out. For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide . --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters. To list IAM users The following list-users command lists the IAM users in the current account: aws iam list-users Output: "Users": [ { "UserName": "Adele", "Path": "/", "CreateDate": "2013-03-07T05:14:48Z", "UserId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE", "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Adele" }, { "UserName": "Bob", "Path": "/", "CreateDate": "2012-09-21T23:03:13Z", "UserId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE", "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob" } ] For more information, see Listing Users in the Using IAM guide. Users -> (list) A list of users. (structure) Contains information about an IAM user entity. This data type is used as a response element in the following operations: - CreateUser - GetUser - ListUsers Path -> (string) The path to the user. For more information about paths, see IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide . The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user. UserName -> (string)The friendly name identifying the user. UserId -> (string)The stable and unique string identifying the user. For more information about IDs, see IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide . Arn -> (string)The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide . CreateDate -> (timestamp)The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the user was created. PasswordLastUsed -> (timestamp) The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the Credential reports topic in the IAM User Guide . If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because: - The user never had a password. - A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014. A null value does not mean that the user never had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used. This value is returned only in the GetUser and ListUsers operations. PermissionsBoundary -> (structure) For more information about permissions boundaries, see Permissions boundaries for IAM identities in the IAM User Guide . PermissionsBoundaryType -> (string)The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a value of Policy . PermissionsBoundaryArn -> (string)The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for the user or role. Tags -> (list) A list of tags that are associated with the user. For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide . (structure) A structure that represents user-provided metadata that can be associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide . Key -> (string)The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated value. For example, Department or Cost Center are common choices. Value -> (string) The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of Department could have values such as Human Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but with different values. Note Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code. IsTruncated -> (boolean) A flag that indicates whether there are more items to return. If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that you receive all your results. Marker -> (string) When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
