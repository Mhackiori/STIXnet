Day 70: Hijacking VNC (Enum, Brute, Access and Crack) VNC Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other direction. It uses port 5900: VNC and 5901: VNC-1. Here are simple ways to find the service, brute the service, access the service and finally crack any VNC passwords you come across.
