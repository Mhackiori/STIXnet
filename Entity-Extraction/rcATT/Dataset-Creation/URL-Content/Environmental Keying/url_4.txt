Impeding Automated Malware Analysis with Environment-sensitive Malware @inproceedings{Song2012ImpedingAM, title={Impeding Automated Malware Analysis with Environment-sensitive Malware}, author={Chengyu Song and Paul Royal and Wenke Lee}, booktitle={HotSec}, year={2012} } To solve the scalability problem introduced by the exponential growth of malware, numerous automated malware analysis techniques have been developed. Unfortunately, all of these approaches make previously unaddressed assumptions that manifest as weaknesses to the tenability of the automated malware analysis process. To highlight this concern, we developed two obfuscation techniques that make the successful execution of a malware sample dependent on the unique properties of the original host it… Topics from this paper 24 Citations An Improved Method to Unveil Malware's Hidden Behavior - Computer ScienceInscrypt - 2017 This paper proposes a new hybrid dynamic analysis scheme by applying function summary based symbolic execution of malware by providing Windows APIs’ summary stub and using unicorn CPU emulator, which can effectively extract malware’s hidden behavior.

GoldenEye: Efficiently and Effectively Unveiling Malware's Targeted Environment - Computer ScienceRAID - 2014 This paper proposes a new dynamic analysis scheme that speculatively execute a malware sample and adaptively switch to the right environment during the analysis, and shows that it can actually use less memory space and achieve much higher speed than existing schemes. Analysis of Evasion Techniques in Web-based Malware - Computer Science - 2013 This dissertation focuses on the defenses against web-based malware protected by advanced evasion techniques from both defensive and offensive perspectives, and proposes a combination of obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques, targeting these limitations, which can hide existing web- based malware from state-of-the-art detectors. 0 Handling Anti-Virtual Machine Techniques in Malicious Software - Computer Science - 2017 A detect-and-hide approach, which systematically addresses anti-VM techniques in malware by proposing cardinal pill testing – a modification of red pill testing that aims to enumerate the differences between a given VM and a physical machine, through carefully designed tests. Handling Anti-Virtual Machine Techniques in Malicious Software - Computer ScienceTOPS - 2017 This article proposes cardinal pill testing—a modification of red pill testing that aims to enumerate the differences between a given VM and a physical machine through carefully designed tests and proposes VM Cloak—a WinDbg plug-in which hides the presence of VMs from malware. A Framework for Understanding Dynamic Anti-Analysis Defenses - Computer SciencePPREW@ACSAC - 2014 This paper proposes an information-flow-based framework that encompasses a wide variety of anti-analysis defenses and can provide insights into the underlying structure of various anti- analysis defenses and thereby help devise techniques for neutralizing them. CAMP: Content-Agnostic Malware Protection - Computer ScienceNDSS - 2013 CAMP is a content-agnostic malware protection system based on binary reputation that is built into the browser and determines the reputation of most downloads locally, relying on server-side reputation data only when a local decision cannot be made. References SHOWING 1-10 OF 18 REFERENCES Impeding Malware Analysis Using Conditional Code Obfuscation - Computer ScienceNDSS - 2008 This work has implemented a compiler-level tool that takes a malware source program and automatically generates an obfuscated binary and provides insight into the strengths, weaknesses, and possible ways to strengthen current analysis approaches in order to defeat this malware obfuscation technique. PolyUnpack: Automating the Hidden-Code Extraction of Unpack-Executing Malware - Computer Science2006 22nd Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC'06) - 2006 The results from the experiments show the approach can be used to significantly reduce the time required to analyze such malware, and to improve the performance of malware detection tools. Effective and Efficient Malware Detection at the End Host - Computer ScienceUSENIX Security Symposium - 2009 A novel malware detection approach is proposed that is both effective and efficient, and thus, can be used to replace or complement traditional antivirus software at the end host. Ether: malware analysis via hardware virtualization extensions - Computer ScienceCCS - 2008 Ether, a transparent and external approach to malware analysis, is proposed, which is motivated by the intuition that for a malware analyzer to be transparent, it must not induce any side-effects that are unconditionally detectable by malware. Deobfuscation of virtualization-obfuscated software: a semantics-based approach - Computer ScienceCCS '11 - 2011 This paper proposes a different approach to the problem that focuses on identifying instructions that affect the observable behavior of the obfuscated code, and aims to complement existing techniques by broadening the domain of obfuscated programs eligible for automated analysis.
