Contribute Threat Category: Malicious or privacy-invasive application ID: APP-14 Threat Description: Like well-behaved apps, a trojan app offers some functionality to the user, though a trojan also includes hidden functionality that is malicious or otherwise undesirable. One technique for deploying trojan functionality is to obtain the install packages for a legitimate app, decompile/disassemble it, introduce the trojan, and then generate a new install package. The app will appear to a user to be the legitimate app. Distribution of trojans is commonly achieved by submission to open 3rd party app stores or social engineering attacks claiming to offer users the app with incentives (lower cost, free, extras unlocked, etc.).

Use application threat intelligence data about potentially harmful apps installed on COPE or BYOD devicesMobile Device User Use Android Verify Apps feature to identify potentially harmful apps.Mobile App Developer To reduce the ease of an attacker to abuse existing app functionality, only request access to the minimal set of shared data stores (e.g., contacts, calendar), OS services (e.g. location services), and device sensors (e.g. camera, microphone) necessary for the app to provide functionality.
