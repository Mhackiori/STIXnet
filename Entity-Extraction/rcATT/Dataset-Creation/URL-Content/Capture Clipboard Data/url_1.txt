Adversaries may abuse Clipboard Manager APIs to obtain sensitive information copied to the global clipboard. For example, passwords being copy-and-pasted from a password manager app could be captured by another application installed on the device.[1] On Android, ClipboardManager.OnPrimaryClipChangedListener can be used by applications to register as a listener and monitor the clipboard for changes.[2] Android 10 mitigates this technique by preventing applications from accessing clipboard data unless the application is on the foreground or is set as the device’s default input method editor (IME).[3] |ID||Name||Description| |S0421||GolfSpy| GolfSpy can obtain clipboard contents.[4] |S0295||RCSAndroid| RCSAndroid can monitor clipboard content.[5] |S0297||XcodeGhost| XcodeGhost can read and write data in the user’s clipboard.[6] |ID||Mitigation||Description| |M1005||Application Vetting| Applications could be vetted for their use of the clipboard manager APIs with extra scrutiny given to application that make use of them. |M1006||Use Recent OS Version| Android 10 prevents applications from accessing clipboard data unless the application is on the foreground or is set as the device’s default input method editor (IME).[3] Capturing clipboard content can be difficult to detect, and therefore enterprises may be better served focusing on detection at other stages of adversarial behavior.
