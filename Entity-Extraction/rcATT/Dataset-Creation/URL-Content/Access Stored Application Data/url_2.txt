Contribute Threat Category: Authentication: User or Device to Remote Service ID: AUT-0 Threat Description: Attackers able to steal authorized credentials could potentially login to sensitive services or devices, and gain unauthorized access to privileged information.

To mitigate an attacker’s ability to achieve authentication using a stolen credential, when possible, configure services to use multi-factor authentication. Ideally, the additional factor should be provided by a separate device than the one being used to perform primary authentication (e.g., laptop and mobile app). Further, avoid the use of SMS messages for 2FA codes, as SMS messages can be readily intercepted. To limit the value of stolen credentials to an attacker, use centralized identity and access management tools that permit simultaneous revocation of stolen authentication credentials across all access control mechanisms and terminate active sessions based on those credentials. To limit the value of stolen credentials, enforce a policy that limits the maximum age of credentials and limits the use of identical or similar credentials. To limit the value of stolen credentials, enforce an access policy that restricts the resources a user can access based on location parameters (e.g. domain, IP address, MAC address, geolocation) of the authentication request. Incorporate the principle of least privilege to limit lateral movement by an attacker with stolen credentials. To limit the potential for predictive attacks on new passwords, employ authentication mechanisms that utilizes randomly generated one-time passwords or tokens for access from untrusted locations. To prevent an attacker with a stolen password from locking out the legitimate user or defining new credentials, require 2-factor authentication mechanisms to change authentication credentials or credential recovery processes.Mobile Device User To mitigate an attacker’s ability to achieve authentication using a stolen credential, when possible, configure services to use multi-factor authentication.
