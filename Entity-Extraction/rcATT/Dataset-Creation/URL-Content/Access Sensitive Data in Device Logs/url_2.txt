Contribute Threat Category: Vulnerable Applications ID: APP-3 Threat Description: Mobile application developers may unintentionally expose sensitive information by storing it in system logs designed to troubleshoot problems. An example would be logging the username and password for a failed user-to-app authentication attempt. An attacker with access to the system log would gain unauthorized access to the information. Threat Origin Not Applicable, See Exploit or CVE Examples Exploit Examples Not Applicable CVE Examples Possible Countermeasures Avoid logging sensitive data in an unencrypted state, even to files internal to the app, as these files may be exposed in backups or direct access to the deviceâ€™s file system. Use the Compatibility Test Suite, which checks for the presence of potentially sensitive information in the system logs; See https://source.android.com/security/overview/implement.html.Enterprise Consider the use of devices that support Android 4.1 or later, in which apps can no longer access the system log (other than reading log entries added by the app itself). Use app-vetting tools or services to identify apps that store sensitive information in system logs or other unsecure storage locations.Mobile Device User Consider the use of devices that support Android 4.1 or later, in which apps can no longer access the system log (other than reading log entries added by the app itself).
