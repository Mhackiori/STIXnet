A malicious application could suppress its icon from being displayed to the user in the application launcher to hide the fact that it is installed, and to make it more difficult for the user to uninstall the application. Hiding the application's icon programmatically does not require any special permissions. This behavior has been seen in the BankBot/Spy Banker family of malware.[1][2][3] |ID||Name||Description| |S0440||Agent Smith| Agent Smith can hide its icon from the application launcher.[4] |S0525||Android/AdDisplay.Ashas| Android/AdDisplay.Ashas can hide its icon and create a shortcut based on the C2 server response.[5] |S0655||BusyGasper| BusyGasper can hide its icon.[6] |S0480||Cerberus| Cerberus hides its icon from the application drawer after being launched for the first time.[7] |S0505||Desert Scorpion| Desert Scorpion can hide its icon.[8] |S0550||DoubleAgent| DoubleAgent has hidden its app icon.[9] |S0509||FakeSpy| FakeSpy can hide its icon if it detects that it is being run on an emulator.[10] |S0408||FlexiSpy| FlexiSpy is capable of hiding SuperSU's icon if it is installed and visible.[11] FlexiSpy can also hide its own icon to make detection and the uninstallation process more difficult.[12] |S0423||Ginp| Ginp hides its icon after installation.[13] |S0406||Gustuff| Gustuff hides its icon after installation.[14] |S0485||Mandrake| Mandrake can hide its icon on older Android versions.[15] |S0411||Rotexy| Rotexy hides its icon after first launch.[16] |S0419||SimBad| SimBad hides its icon from the application launcher.[17] |S0558||Tiktok Pro| Tiktok Pro can hide its icon after launch.[18] |S0302||Twitoor| Twitoor can hide its presence on the system.[19] |S0418||ViceLeaker| ViceLeaker includes code to hide its icon, but the function does not appear to be called in an analyzed version of the software.[20] This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features. The user can examine the list of all installed applications, including those with a suppressed icon, in the device settings.
