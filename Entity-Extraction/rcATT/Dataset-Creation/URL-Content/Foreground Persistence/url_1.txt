Adversaries may abuse Android's startForeground() API method to maintain continuous sensor access. Beginning in Android 9, idle applications running in the background no longer have access to device sensors, such as the camera, microphone, and gyroscope.[1] Applications can retain sensor access by running in the foreground, using Android’s startForeground() API method. This informs the system that the user is actively interacting with the application, and it should not be killed. The only requirement to start a foreground service is showing a persistent notification to the user.[2] Malicious applications may abuse the startForeground() API method to continue running in the foreground, while presenting a notification to the user pretending to be a genuine application. This would allow unhindered access to the device’s sensors, assuming permission has been previously granted.[3] Malicious applications may also abuse the startForeground() API to inform the Android system that the user is actively interacting with the application, thus preventing it from being killed by the low memory killer.[4] |ID||Name||Description| |S0485||Mandrake| Mandrake uses foreground persistence to keep a service running. It shows the user a transparent notification to evade detection.[5] |S0545||TERRACOTTA| TERRACOTTA has utilized foreground services.[6] |S0558||Tiktok Pro| Tiktok Pro has shown a persistent notification to maintain access to device sensors.[7] |ID||Mitigation||Description| |M1005||Application Vetting| Applications could be vetted for their use of the |M1011||User Guidance| If a user sees a persistent notification they do not recognize, they should uninstall the source application and look for other unwanted applications or anomalies. Users can see persistent notifications in their notification drawer and can subsequently uninstall applications that do not belong.
