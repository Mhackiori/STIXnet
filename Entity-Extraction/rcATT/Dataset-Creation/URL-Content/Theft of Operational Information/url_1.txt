Theft of Operational Information Jump to navigation Jump to search |Theft of Operational Information| |Technique| |ID||T0882| |Tactic||Impact| Description Adversaries may steal operational information on a production environment as a direct mission outcome for personal gain or to inform future operations. This information may include design documents, schedules, rotational data, or similar artifacts that provide insight on operations. In the Bowman Dam incident, adversaries probed systems for operational data.12 Procedure Examples - Dragonfly 2.0 captured ICS vendor names, reference documents, wiring diagrams, and panel layouts about the process environment.3 - ACAD/Medre.A can collect AutoCad files with drawings. These drawings may contain operational information.4 - Duqu’s purpose is to "gather intelligence data and assets from entities such as industrial infrastructure and system manufacturers, amongst others not in the industrial sector, in order to more easily conduct a future attack against another third party."5 - Flame can collect AutoCAD design data and visio diagrams as well as other documents that may contain operational information.6 - REvil sends exfiltrated data from the victim’s system using HTTPS POST messages sent to the C2 system.78 Mitigations - Operational Information Confidentiality - Example mitigations could include minimizing its distribution/storage or obfuscating the information (e.g., facility coverterms, codenames). In many cases this information may be necessary to support critical engineering, maintenance, or operational functions, therefore, it may not be feasible to implement. - Data Loss Prevention - Apply DLP to protect the confidentiality of information related to operational processes, facility locations, device configurations, programs, or databases that may have information that can be used to infer organizational trade-secrets, recipes, and other intellectual property (IP). - Encrypt Sensitive Information - Encrypt any operational data with strong confidentiality requirements, including organizational trade-secrets, recipes, and other intellectual property (IP). - Restrict File and Directory Permissions - Protect files stored locally with proper permissions to limit opportunities for adversaries to interact and collect information from databases.910 References - ^ Mark Thompson.
