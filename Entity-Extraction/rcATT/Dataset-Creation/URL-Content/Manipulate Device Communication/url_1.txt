If network traffic between the mobile device and a remote server is not securely protected, then an attacker positioned on the network may be able to manipulate network communication without being detected. For example, FireEye researchers found in 2014 that 68% of the top 1,000 free applications in the Google Play Store had at least one Transport Layer Security (TLS) implementation vulnerability potentially opening the applications' network traffic to adversary-in-the-middle attacks [1]. |ID||Mitigation||Description| |M1005||Application Vetting| Application vetting techniques can scan for use of cleartext communication, insecure TrustManager implementations, and other potential network communication weaknesses. The Google Play Store now automatically assesses submitted applications for insecure TrustManager implementations.[2] |M1009||Encrypt Network Traffic| App developers should be advised to use the Android Network Security Configuration feature and the iOS App Transport Security feature to gain some level of assurance that app network traffic is protected.[2]
