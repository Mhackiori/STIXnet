Contribute Threat Category: Vulnerable Applications ID: APP-1 Threat Description: Apps that exchange information with a back-end server should strongly authenticate the server before attemtping to establish a secure connection. If the authentication mechanism used by the app is weak, such as not validating a server certificate, an attacker can readily impersonate the back-end server to the app and achieve a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This would provide an attacker with unauthorized access to all unencrypted transmitted data, including modification of data-in-transit. A successful MITM greatly facilitates further attacks against the client app, the back-end server, and all parties of a compromised session.

On Android devices, use the Android Network Security Policy feature, Certificate Pinning. To reduce the impact of a successful MiTM attack on your application, consider the use of public key cryptography to protect sensitive data destined for back-end servers prior to transmission off the device.Enterprise App vetting tools/services or pen testing to detect MiTM vulnerabilities in mobile apps.
