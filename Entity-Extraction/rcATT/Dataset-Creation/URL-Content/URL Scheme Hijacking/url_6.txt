MobileIron was founded in 2007 by Ajay Mishra and Suresh Batchu as the industry’s first mobile-centric, zero trust platform built on a unified endpoint management (UEM) foundation. MobileIron’s mobile-centric, zero trust approach ensured that only authorized users, devices, apps and services could access business resources. The company went public in 2014, trading under the ticker symbol MOBL. MobileIron was acquired by Ivanti on December 1, 2020.
