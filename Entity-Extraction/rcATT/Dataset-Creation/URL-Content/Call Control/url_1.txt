Adversaries may make, forward, or block phone calls without user authorization. This could be used for adversary goals such as audio surveillance, blocking or forwarding calls from the device owner, or C2 communication. Several permissions may be used to programmatically control phone calls, including: ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS- Allows the application to answer incoming phone calls[1] CALL_PHONE- Allows the application to initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer interface[1] PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS- Allows the application to see the number being dialed during an outgoing call with the option to redirect the call to a different number or abort the call altogether[1] MANAGE_OWN_CALLS- Allows a calling application which manages its own calls through the self-managed ConnectionServiceAPIs[1] BIND_TELECOM_CONNECTION_SERVICE- Required permission when using a ConnectionService[1] WRITE_CALL_LOG- Allows an application to write to the device call log, potentially to hide malicious phone calls[1] When granted some of these permissions, an application can make a phone call without opening the dialer first. However, if an application desires to simply redirect the user to the dialer with a phone number filled in, it can launch an Intent using Intent.ACTION_DIAL, which requires no specific permissions. This then requires the user to explicitly initiate the call or use some form of Input Injection to programmatically initiate it. |ID||Name||Description| |S0422||Anubis| Anubis can make phone calls.[2] |S0655||BusyGasper| BusyGasper can open a hidden menu when a specific phone number is called from the infected device.[3] |S0529||CarbonSteal| CarbonSteal can silently accept an incoming phone call.[4] |S0407||Monokle| Monokle can be controlled via phone call from a set of "control phones."[5] |ID||Mitigation||Description| |M1005||Application Vetting| Application vetting services could provide further scrutiny to applications that request permissions related to phone calls. |M1011||User Guidance| Users should be encouraged to be very careful with what applications they grant phone call-based permissions to. Further, users should not change their default call handler to applications they do not recognize. Users can view their default phone app in device settings. Users can review available call logs for irregularities, such as missing or unrecognized calls.
