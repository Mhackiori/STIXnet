Android Security Symposium 2015 Android and trusted execution environments About the speaker Jan-Erik Ekberg Abstract Over the last years, third-party provisionable Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have seen increasing market presence, one estimate is that 0.5B handsets have been shipped with one, at least 350M of these are Android handsets. Interface standards in the field are also maturing. My talk will focus on the deployed TEE ecosystem with an Android perspective - outlining what a TEE architecturally is, which components and services it typically contains and which processing / processor services form the fundament of the TEE security argument. I will briefly touch on recent platform alternatives for TEE development and research, as well as which directions in which we see TEEs evolving in the near future. I will round up by motivating TEE usefulness through a few selected use-cases like mobile payments and identity, as well as a few architecture and application results we have recently reached in the new domain of TEEs in servers (Cloud), primarily in collaboration with Aalto University, Helsinki.
