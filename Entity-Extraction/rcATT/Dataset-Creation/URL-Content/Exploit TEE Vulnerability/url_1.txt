A malicious app or other attack vector could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in code running within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) [1]. The adversary could then obtain privileges held by the TEE potentially including the ability to access cryptographic keys or other sensitive data [2]. Escalated operating system privileges may be first required in order to have the ability to attack the TEE [3]. If not, privileges within the TEE can potentially be used to exploit the operating system [4]. |ID||Mitigation||Description| |M1005||Application Vetting| |M1001||Security Updates| |M1006||Use Recent OS Version|
