On Android, an adversary could call standard operating system APIs from a malicious application to gather call log data, or with escalated privileges could directly access files containing call log data. On iOS, applications do not have access to the call log, so privilege escalation would be required in order to access the data. |ID||Name||Description| |S0309||Adups| Adups transmitted call logs.[1] |S0304||Android/Chuli.A| Android/Chuli.A stole call logs.[2] |S0292||AndroRAT| AndroRAT collects call logs.[3] |S0425||Corona Updates| Corona Updates can collect the device’s call log.[4] |S0550||DoubleAgent| DoubleAgent has accessed the call logs.[5] |S0320||DroidJack| DroidJack captures call data.[6] |S0405||Exodus| Exodus Two can exfiltrate the call log.[7] |S0182||FinFisher| FinFisher accesses and exfiltrates the call log.[8] |S0551||GoldenEagle| GoldenEagle has collected call logs.[5] |S0421||GolfSpy| GolfSpy can obtain the device’s call log.[9] |S0544||HenBox| HenBox has collected all outgoing phone numbers that start with "86".[10] |S0463||INSOMNIA| INSOMNIA can retrieve the call history.[11] |S0407||Monokle| Monokle can retrieve call history.[12] |S0399||Pallas| Pallas accesses and exfiltrates the call log.[8] |S0316||Pegasus for Android| Pegasus for Android accesses call logs.[13] |S0289||Pegasus for iOS| Pegasus for iOS captures call logs.[14] |S0539||Red Alert 2.0| Red Alert 2.0 can collect the device’s call log.[15] |S0549||SilkBean| SilkBean can access call logs.[5] |S0324||SpyDealer| SpyDealer harvests phone call history from victims.[16] |S0328||Stealth Mango| Stealth Mango uploads call logs.[17] |S0329||Tangelo| Tangelo contains functionality to gather call logs.[17] |S0558||Tiktok Pro| Tiktok Pro can collect the device’s call logs.[18] |S0418||ViceLeaker| ViceLeaker can collect the device’s call log.[19] |S0506||ViperRAT| ViperRAT can collect the device’s call log.[20] |S0489||WolfRAT| WolfRAT can collect the device’s call log.[21] |ID||Mitigation||Description| |M1005||Application Vetting| On Android, accessing the device call log requires that the app hold the READ_CALL_LOG permission. Apps that request this permission could be closely scrutinized to ensure that the request is appropriate. |M1001||Security Updates| Decrease likelihood of successful privilege escalation attack. |M1006||Use Recent OS Version| Decrease likelihood of successful privilege escalation attack. On Android 6.0 and up, the user can view which applications have permission to access call log information through the device settings screen, and the user can choose to revoke the permissions.
