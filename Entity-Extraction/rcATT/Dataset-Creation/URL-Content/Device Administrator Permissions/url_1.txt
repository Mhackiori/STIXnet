Adversaries may request device administrator permissions to perform malicious actions. By abusing the device administration API, adversaries can perform several nefarious actions, such as resetting the device’s password for Device Lockout, factory resetting the device to Delete Device Data and any traces of the malware, disabling all of the device’s cameras, or make it more difficult to uninstall the app.[1] Device administrators must be approved by the user at runtime, with a system popup showing which of the actions have been requested by the app. In conjunction with other techniques, such as Input Injection, an app can programmatically grant itself administrator permissions without any user input. |ID||Name||Description| |S0540||Asacub| Asacub can request device administrator permissions.[2] |S0522||Exobot| Exobot can request device administrator permissions.[3] |S0536||GPlayed| GPlayed can request device administrator permissions.[4] |S0485||Mandrake| Mandrake can abuse device administrator permissions to ensure that it cannot be uninstalled until its permissions are revoked.[5] |S0317||Marcher| Marcher requests Android Device Administrator access.[6] |S0286||OBAD| OBAD abuses device administrator access to make it more difficult for users to remove the application.[7] |S0539||Red Alert 2.0| Red Alert 2.0 can request device administrator permissions.[8] |S0318||XLoader for Android| XLoader for Android requests Android Device Administrator access.[9] |ID||Mitigation||Description| |M1005||Application Vetting| Application vetting can check for the string |M1006||Use Recent OS Version| Changes were introduced in Android 7 to make abuse of device administrator permissions more difficult.[10] |M1011||User Guidance| Users should be told that it is very rare for an app to request device administrator permissions, and that any requests for the permissions should be scrutinized. Users can see when an app requests device administrator permissions. Users can also view which apps have device administrator permissions in the settings menu.
