Contribute Threat Category: Malicious or privacy-invasive application ID: APP-22 Threat Description: The Device Administrator permission in Android is designed to allow enterprises to develop apps that can manage settings on users devices to enforce compliance with the enterprise mobile device security policy. Prior to Android 6.0, the Device Administrator role could enforce a policy that disabled uninstallation of an app. Malicious applications could abuse this behavior to gain persistence on the device. Since Android 6.0, users can always unregister a given app as a Device Administrator, which disables all associated policies and would restore the ability to uninstall the malicious app. Threat Origin Android Security 2015 Year In Review 1 Exploit Examples Not Applicable CVE Examples Possible Countermeasures Ensure Android devices are running a recent version of the operating system.
