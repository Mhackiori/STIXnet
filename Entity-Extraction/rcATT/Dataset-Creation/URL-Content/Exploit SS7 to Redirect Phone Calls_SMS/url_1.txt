An adversary could exploit signaling system vulnerabilities to redirect calls or text messages (SMS) to a phone number under the attacker's control. The adversary could then act as an adversary-in-the-middle to intercept or manipulate the communication. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Interception of SMS messages could enable adversaries to obtain authentication codes used for multi-factor authentication[6]. |ID||Name||Description| |S0602||Circles| Circles can intercept voice calls and SMS messages.[7] |ID||Mitigation||Description| |M1009||Encrypt Network Traffic| Use of end-to-end encryption of voice calls and text messages "provides another layer in the defense against potential information compromise by SS7 enabled eavesdropping."[5] |M1014||Interconnection Filtering| Network carriers may be able to use firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and/or block SS7 exploitation as described by the Communications, Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council (CSRIC). [5] The CSRIC also suggests threat information sharing between telecommunications industry members.
