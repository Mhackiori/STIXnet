This information may be used to gain more information about the process itself or used as a trigger for malicious actions. The sources of process state information may vary such as, OPC tags, historian data, specific PLC block information, or network traffic. Procedure Examples - Industroyer's OPC and IEC 61850 protocol modules include the ability to send "stVal" requests to read the status of operational variables.1 - Stuxnet examines fields recorded by the DP_RECV monitor to determine if the target system is in a particular state of operation.2 Mitigations - Mitigation Limited or Not Effective - This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.
