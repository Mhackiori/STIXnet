Note: You are viewing the documentation for an older major version of the AWS CLI (version 1). AWS CLI version 2, the latest major version of AWS CLI, is now stable and recommended for general use. To view this page for the AWS CLI version 2, click here. For more information see the AWS CLI version 2 installation instructions and migration guide. [ aws . ssm ] Describes one or more of your managed nodes, including information about the operating system platform, the version of SSM Agent installed on the managed node, node status, and so on. If you specify one or more managed node IDs, it returns information for those managed nodes. If you don't specify node IDs, it returns information for all your managed nodes. If you specify a node ID that isn't valid or a node that you don't own, you receive an error. Note The IamRole field for this API operation is the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role assigned to on-premises managed nodes. This call doesn't return the IAM role for EC2 instances. See also: AWS API Documentation See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters. describe-instance-information is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument. When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: InstanceInformationList describe-instance-information [--instance-information-filter-list <value>] [--filters <value>] [--cli-input-json <value>] [--starting-token <value>] [--page-size <value>] [--max-items <value>] [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>] --instance-information-filter-list (list) This is a legacy method. We recommend that you don't use this method. Instead, use the Filters data type. Filters enables you to return node information by filtering based on tags applied to managed nodes. Note Attempting to use InstanceInformationFilterList and Filters leads to an exception error. (structure) Describes a filter for a specific list of managed nodes. You can filter node information by using tags. You specify tags by using a key-value mapping. Use this operation instead of the DescribeInstanceInformationRequest$InstanceInformationFilterList method. The InstanceInformationFilterList method is a legacy method and doesn't support tags. key -> (string)The name of the filter. valueSet -> (list) The filter values. (string) Shorthand Syntax: key=string,valueSet=string,string ... JSON Syntax: [ { "key": "InstanceIds"|"AgentVersion"|"PingStatus"|"PlatformTypes"|"ActivationIds"|"IamRole"|"ResourceType"|"AssociationStatus", "valueSet": ["string", ...] } ... ] --filters (list) One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of managed nodes. You can filter based on tags applied to EC2 instances. Use this Filters data type instead of InstanceInformationFilterList , which is deprecated. (structure) The filters to describe or get information about your managed nodes. Key -> (string) The filter key name to describe your managed nodes. For example: "InstanceIds"|"AgentVersion"|"PingStatus"|"PlatformTypes"|"ActivationIds"|"IamRole"|"ResourceType"|"AssociationStatus"|"Tag Key" Warning Tag key isn't a valid filter. You must specify either tag-key or tag:keyname and a string. Here are some valid examples: tag-key, tag:123, tag:al!, tag:Windows. Here are some invalid examples: tag-keys, Tag Key, tag:, tagKey, abc:keyname. Values -> (list) The filter values. (string) Shorthand Syntax: Key=string,Values=string,string ... JSON Syntax: [ { "Key": "string", "Values": ["string", ...] } ... ] --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. --starting-token (string) A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response. For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide . --page-size (integer) The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out. For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide . --max-items (integer) The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI. For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide . --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command. See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters. Example 1: To describe managed instance information The following describe-instance-information example retrieves details of each of your managed instances. aws ssm describe-instance-information Example 2: To describe information about a specific managed instance The following describe-instance-information example shows details of the managed instance i-028ea792daEXAMPLE. aws ssm describe-instance-information \ --filters "Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-028ea792daEXAMPLE" Example 3: To describe information about managed instances with a specific tag key The following describe-instance-information example shows details for managed instances that have the tag key DEV. aws ssm describe-instance-information \ --filters "Key=tag-key,Values=DEV" Output: { "InstanceInformationList": [ { "InstanceId": "i-028ea792daEXAMPLE", "PingStatus": "Online", "LastPingDateTime": 1582221233.421, "AgentVersion": "2.3.842.0", "IsLatestVersion": true, "PlatformType": "Linux", "PlatformName": "SLES", "PlatformVersion": "15.1", "ResourceType": "EC2Instance", "IPAddress": "192.0.2.0", "ComputerName": "ip-198.51.100.0.us-east-2.compute.internal", "AssociationStatus": "Success", "LastAssociationExecutionDate": 1582220806.0, "LastSuccessfulAssociationExecutionDate": 1582220806.0, "AssociationOverview": { "DetailedStatus": "Success", "InstanceAssociationStatusAggregatedCount": { "Success": 2 } } } ] } For more information, see Managed Instances in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. InstanceInformationList -> (list) The managed node information list. (structure) Describes a filter for a specific list of managed nodes. InstanceId -> (string)The managed node ID. PingStatus -> (string) Connection status of SSM Agent. Note The status Inactive has been deprecated and is no longer in use. LastPingDateTime -> (timestamp)The date and time when the agent last pinged the Systems Manager service. AgentVersion -> (string)The version of SSM Agent running on your Linux managed node. IsLatestVersion -> (boolean)Indicates whether the latest version of SSM Agent is running on your Linux managed node. This field doesn't indicate whether or not the latest version is installed on Windows managed nodes, because some older versions of Windows Server use the EC2Config service to process Systems Manager requests. PlatformType -> (string)The operating system platform type. PlatformName -> (string)The name of the operating system platform running on your managed node. PlatformVersion -> (string)The version of the OS platform running on your managed node. ActivationId -> (string)The activation ID created by Amazon Web Services Systems Manager when the server or virtual machine (VM) was registered. IamRole -> (string)The Identity and Access Management (IAM) role assigned to the on-premises Systems Manager managed node. This call doesn't return the IAM role for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. To retrieve the IAM role for an EC2 instance, use the Amazon EC2 DescribeInstances operation. For information, see DescribeInstances in the Amazon EC2 API Reference or describe-instances in the Amazon Web Services CLI Command Reference . RegistrationDate -> (timestamp)The date the server or VM was registered with Amazon Web Services as a managed node. ResourceType -> (string)The type of instance. Instances are either EC2 instances or managed instances. Name -> (string)The name assigned to an on-premises server, edge device, or virtual machine (VM) when it is activated as a Systems Manager managed node. The name is specified as the DefaultInstanceName property using the CreateActivation command. It is applied to the managed node by specifying the Activation Code and Activation ID when you install SSM Agent on the node, as explained in Install SSM Agent for a hybrid environment (Linux) and Install SSM Agent for a hybrid environment (Windows) . To retrieve the Name tag of an EC2 instance, use the Amazon EC2 DescribeInstances operation. For information, see DescribeInstances in the Amazon EC2 API Reference or describe-instances in the Amazon Web Services CLI Command Reference . IPAddress -> (string)The IP address of the managed node. ComputerName -> (string)The fully qualified host name of the managed node. AssociationStatus -> (string)The status of the association.
