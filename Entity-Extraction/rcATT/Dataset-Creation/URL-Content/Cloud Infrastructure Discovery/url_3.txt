GetPublicAccessBlock Retrieves the PublicAccessBlock configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have the s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy. When Amazon S3 evaluates the PublicAccessBlock configuration for a bucket or an object, it checks the PublicAccessBlock configuration for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account. If the PublicAccessBlock settings are different between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level settings. For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an object public, see The Meaning of "Public". The following operations are related to GetPublicAccessBlock: Request Syntax GET /?publicAccessBlock HTTP/1.1 Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner URI Request Parameters The request uses the following URI parameters. - Bucket The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose PublicAccessBlockconfiguration you want to retrieve. Required: Yes - x-amz-expected-bucket-owner The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden(access denied). Request Body The request does not have a request body. Response Syntax HTTP/1.1 200 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <PublicAccessBlockConfiguration> <BlockPublicAcls>boolean</BlockPublicAcls> <IgnorePublicAcls>boolean</IgnorePublicAcls> <BlockPublicPolicy>boolean</BlockPublicPolicy> <RestrictPublicBuckets>boolean</RestrictPublicBuckets> </PublicAccessBlockConfiguration> Response Elements If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response. The following data is returned in XML format by the service. - PublicAccessBlockConfiguration Root level tag for the PublicAccessBlockConfiguration parameters. Required: Yes - BlockPublicAcls Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to TRUEcauses the following behavior: PUT Bucket ACL and PUT Object ACL calls fail if the specified ACL is public. PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL. PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL. Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs. Type: Boolean - BlockPublicPolicy Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for this bucket. Setting this element to TRUEcauses Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows public access. Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies. Type: Boolean - IgnorePublicAcls Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting this element to TRUEcauses Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on this bucket and objects in this bucket. Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set. Type: Boolean - RestrictPublicBuckets Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket policies for this bucket. Setting this element to TRUErestricts access to this bucket to only AWS service principals and authorized users within this account if the bucket has a public policy. Enabling this setting doesn't affect previously stored bucket policies, except that public and cross-account access within any public bucket policy, including non-public delegation to specific accounts, is blocked. Type: Boolean Examples Sample Request The following request gets a bucket PublicAccessBlock configuration. GET /<bucket-name>?publicAccessBlock HTTP/1.1 Host: <bucket-name>.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com x-amz-date: <Thu, 15 Nov 2016 00:17:21 GMT> Authorization: <signatureValue> Sample Response This example illustrates one usage of GetPublicAccessBlock.
