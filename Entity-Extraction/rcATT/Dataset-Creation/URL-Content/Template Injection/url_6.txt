Contributors: Sean Baird, Earl Carter, Erick Galinkin, Christopher Marczewski & Joe Marshall Executive Summary Attackers are continually trying to find new ways to target users with malware sent via email. Talos has identified an email-based attack targeting the energy sector, including nuclear power, that puts a new spin on the classic word document attachment phish. Typically, malicious Word documents that are sent as attachments to phishing emails will themselves contain a script or macro that executes malicious code. In this case, there is no malicious code in the attachment itself. The attachment instead tries to download a template file over an SMB connection so that the user's credentials can be silently harvested. In addition, this template file could also potentially be used to download other malicious payloads to the victim's computer. Background Since at least May 2017, Talos has observed attackers targeting critical infrastructure and energy companies around the world, primarily in Europe and the United States. These attacks target both the critical infrastructure providers, and the vendors those providers use to deliver critical services. Attacks on critical infrastructure are not a new concern for security researchers, as adversaries are keen to understand critical infrastructure ICS networks for reasons unknown, but surely nefarious. One objective of this most recent attack appears to be to harvest credentials of users who work within critical infrastructure and manufacturing industries. Using a new twist on an old attack method, a clever adversary stole credentials from their victims by sending malicious word documents via email. These documents when opened, attempt to retrieve a template file from an attacker controlled external SMB server. Technical Investigation In the midst of recent attack trends and global campaigns, it has become easier to pass over simple techniques that serve attackers' best interests for years. As Talos has recently observed, sometimes new takes on reliable techniques can make them even more effective. While investigating a recently reported attack and pivoting on the data provided, we landed on several interesting DOCX samples which were delivered as attachments in malicious spam emails. As shown below, these documents often claimed to be environmental reports or resum√©s/CVs. |Sample email containing a malicious document| |One DOCX sample used during this attack| |Another DOCX sample used during this attack| Our first expectation was that we would find some malicious VBA macros or embedded scripting within the sample itself. Examination of the VBA code provided no such leads: |Analysis of the document using oletools| |Further analysis of the DOCX| At the loading screen for Word, we noticed something interesting: |Word attempting to load a template| |Instance of template injection found in the document| |Sandbox PCAP of the sample| |GitHub page of the Phishery tool| Suprisingly, the same ID is found at the bottom of the aforementioned Go source: |"rId1337" found in the Phishery tool, line 105.| 1. Mere coincidence (always a possibility); 2. The attackers took notice of this tool and either modified it or developed their attack from scratch while sticking to the same concept used by the tool; or 3. The attackers used the same Relationship ID to thwart analysis of the attack itself (remember: our first inclination was to follow-up on the failed connection attempts over TCP 80). At this time, there is no evidence to confirm any of the three possibilities. However, the attackers' reliance on a successful SMB session stemming from outbound traffic over TCP 445 further confirms that organizations are still failing to properly block such egress traffic to public hosts. With no credential prompt needed for the SMB variation, we can come to understand the simplicity and effectiveness of such a technique. If an attacker is able to compromise a host and run such a server internally, the situation becomes significantly more grave. Furthermore, since the attacker controlled SMB server was down when we analyzed these samples, it is not possible to determine the ultimate payloads (if any) that could have been dropped by the template being downloaded. As we have seen with recent attacks, the intent of an attack is not always obvious. Forcing SMB requests to an external server has been a known security vulnerability for many years. Without further information it is impossible to conclude what the true scope of this attack was or what malicious payloads could have been involved. Conclusion Talos responded to these attacks by reaching out to known affected customers and ensuring that they were aware of and capable of responding to the threat. It also illustrates the importance of controlling your network traffic and not allowing outbound protocols such as SMB except where specifically required for your environment. Additionally, a number of ClamAV signatures and email rules were written in order to ensure that threats leveraging this Office template injection technique are blocked in the future. Coverage ClamAV signatures created to identify this attack: Doc.Tool.Phishery-6331699-0 Doc.Downloader.TemplateInjection-6332119-0 Doc.Downloader.TemplateInjection-6332123-0 Additional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below. Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) blocks the malicious word documents used by these threat actors. CWS, WSA, and Umbrella can help identify outbound connections used by these threat actors. Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign. AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and builds protection into all Cisco Security products. IOCs Due to the nature in which we obtained intelligence related to these attacks, we are unable to share all of the IOCs related to this event; however, we wanted to share as much as possible in the spirit of transparency and collaboration.

The http traffic is likely due to the WEBDAV system attempting to fetch metadata. This occurs when UNC paths are loaded.ReplyDelete
