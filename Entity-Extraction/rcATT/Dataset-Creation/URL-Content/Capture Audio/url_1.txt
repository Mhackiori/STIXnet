Adversaries may capture audio to collect information on a user of a mobile device using standard operating system APIs. Adversaries may target audio information such as user conversations, surroundings, phone calls, or other sensitive information. Android and iOS, by default, requires that an application request access to microphone devices from the user. In Android, applications must hold the android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO permission to access the microphone and the android.permission.CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT permission to access audio output such as speakers. Android does not allow third-party applications to hold android.permission.CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT, so audio output can only be obtained by privileged applications (distributed by Google or the device vendor) or after a successful privilege escalation attack. In iOS, applications must include the NSMicrophoneUsageDescription key in their Info.plist file. |ID||Name||Description| |S0292||AndroRAT| AndroRAT gathers audio from the microphone.[1] |S0422||Anubis| Anubis can record phone calls and audio.[2] |S0655||BusyGasper| BusyGasper can record audio.[3] |S0529||CarbonSteal| CarbonSteal can remotely capture device audio.[4] |S0425||Corona Updates| Corona Updates can record MP4 files and monitor calls.[5] |S0301||Dendroid| Dendroid can record audio and outgoing calls.[6] |S0505||Desert Scorpion| Desert Scorpion can record audio from phone calls and the device microphone.[7] |S0550||DoubleAgent| DoubleAgent has captured audio and can record phone calls.[4] |S0320||DroidJack| DroidJack is capable of recording device phone calls.[8] |S0507||eSurv| eSurv can record audio.[9] |S0405||Exodus| Exodus Two can record audio from the compromised device's microphone and can record call audio in 3GP format.[10] |S0182||FinFisher| FinFisher uses the device microphone to record phone conversations.[11] |S0408||FlexiSpy| FlexiSpy can record both incoming and outgoing phone calls, as well as microphone audio.[12] |S0577||FrozenCell| FrozenCell has recorded calls.[13] |S0535||Golden Cup| Golden Cup can record audio from the microphone and phone calls.[14] |S0551||GoldenEagle| GoldenEagle has recorded calls and environment audio in .amr format.[4] |S0421||GolfSpy| GolfSpy can record audio and phone calls.[15] |S0544||HenBox| HenBox can access the device’s microphone.[16] |S0407||Monokle| Monokle can record audio from the device's microphone and can record phone calls, specifying the output audio quality.[17] |S0399||Pallas| Pallas captures audio from the device microphone.[11] |S0316||Pegasus for Android| Pegasus for Android has the ability to record device audio.[18] |S0289||Pegasus for iOS| Pegasus for iOS has the ability to record audio.[19] |S0295||RCSAndroid| RCSAndroid can record audio using the device microphone.[20] |S0326||RedDrop| RedDrop captures live recordings of the device's surroundings.[21] |S0327||Skygofree| Skygofree can record audio via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location.[22] |S0324||SpyDealer| SpyDealer can record phone calls and surrounding audio.[23] |S0305||SpyNote RAT| SpyNote RAT can activate the victim's microphone.[24] |S0328||Stealth Mango| Stealth Mango can record audio using the device microphone.[25] |S0329||Tangelo| Tangelo contains functionality to record calls as well as the victim device's environment.[25] |S0558||Tiktok Pro| Tiktok Pro can capture audio from the device’s microphone and can record phone calls.[26] |S0418||ViceLeaker| ViceLeaker can record audio from the device’s microphone and can record phone calls together with the caller ID.[27][28] |S0506||ViperRAT| ViperRAT can collect and record audio content.[29] |G0112||Windshift| Windshift has included phone call and audio recording capabilities in the malicious apps deployed as part of Operation BULL and Operation ROCK.[30] |S0489||WolfRAT| WolfRAT can record call audio.[31] |S0318||XLoader for Android| XLoader for Android covertly records phone calls.[32] |ID||Mitigation||Description| |M1005||Application Vetting| Applications using the android permission |M1006||Use Recent OS Version| Android 9 and above restricts access to microphone, camera, and other sensors from background applications.[33] On both Android (6.0 and up) and iOS, the user can view which applications have permission to use the microphone through the device settings screen, and the user can choose to revoke the permissions.
