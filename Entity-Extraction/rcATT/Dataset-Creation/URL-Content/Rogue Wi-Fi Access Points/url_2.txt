Contribute Threat Category: Network Threats: Wi-Fi ID: LPN-0 Threat Description: Public, unsecure access points are subject to rogue access point attacks. This could allow adversaries to man-in-the-middle traffic going to and from devices connected to the network. Threat Origin Guidelines for Securing Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) (SP 800-153) 1 Exploit Examples Darkhotel: A Sophisticated New Hacking Attack Targets High-Profile Hotel Guests 2 CVE Examples Not Applicable Possible Countermeasures Avoid the use of untrusted and unencrypted Wi-Fi networks, particularly when needing to access sensitive services. When needing to connect to untrusted and unencrypted Wi-Fi networks, attempt to verify with a representative of the hosting organization (e.g., coffe shop employee) that the detected network is the correct one. To reduce the probability of connecting to rogue access points, use Wi-Fi hotspot services that associate access points with registered Wi-Fi provider, geolocation, and crowd-sourced reputation data to make assertions about the their apparent trustworthiness.Enterprise To reduce the probability of connecting to rogue access points, use Wi-Fi hotspot services that associate access points with registered Wi-Fi provider, geolocation, and crowd-sourced reputation data to make assertions about the their apparent trustworthiness. To avoid this threat, only allow mobile devices to connect to authorized Wi-Fi networks that use WPA2 encryption. References M. Souppaya and K.
