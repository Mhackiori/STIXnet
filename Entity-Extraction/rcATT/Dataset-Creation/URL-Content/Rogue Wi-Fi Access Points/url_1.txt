An adversary could set up unauthorized Wi-Fi access points or compromise existing access points and, if the device connects to them, carry out network-based attacks such as eavesdropping on or modifying network communication[1][2]. |ID||Mitigation||Description| |M1009||Encrypt Network Traffic| Application-layer encryption (e.g. use of the Transport Layer Security protocol) or a Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel (e.g. using the IPsec protocol) may help mitigate use of untrusted Wi-Fi networks. |M1012||Enterprise Policy| Enterprise policies could be provisioned to devices to control the Wi-Fi access points that they are allowed to connect to.
