Adversaries may seek to identify all applications installed on the device. One use case for doing so is to identify the presence of endpoint security applications that may increase the adversary's risk of detection. Another use case is to identify the presence of applications that the adversary may wish to target. On Android, applications can use methods in the PackageManager class [1] to enumerate other apps installed on device, or an entity with shell access can use the pm command line tool. On iOS, apps can use private API calls to obtain a list of other apps installed on the device. [2] However, use of private API calls will likely prevent the application from being distributed through Apple's App Store. |ID||Name||Description| |S0440||Agent Smith| Agent Smith obtains the deviceâ€™s application list.[3] |S0525||Android/AdDisplay.Ashas| Android/AdDisplay.Ashas has checked to see how many apps are installed, and specifically if Facebook or FB Messenger are installed.[4] |S0422||Anubis| Anubis can collect a list of installed applications to compare to a list of targeted applications.[5] |S0529||CarbonSteal| CarbonSteal has looked for specific applications, such as MiCode.[6] |S0480||Cerberus| Cerberus can obtain a list of installed applications.[7] |S0479||DEFENSOR ID| DEFENSOR ID can retrieve a list of installed applications.[8] |S0505||Desert Scorpion| Desert Scorpion can obtain a list of installed applications.[9] |S0550||DoubleAgent| DoubleAgent has accessed the list of installed apps.[6] |S0478||EventBot| EventBot can collect a list of installed applications.[10] |S0522||Exobot| Exobot can obtain a list of installed applications and can detect if an antivirus application is running, and close it if it is.[11] |S0405||Exodus| Exodus Two can obtain a list of installed applications.[12] |S0509||FakeSpy| FakeSpy can collect a list of installed applications.[13] |S0408||FlexiSpy| FlexiSpy can retrieve a list of installed applications.[14] |S0423||Ginp| Ginp can obtain a list of installed applications.[15] |S0535||Golden Cup| Golden Cup can obtain a list of installed applications.[16] |S0551||GoldenEagle| GoldenEagle has collected a list of installed application names.[6] |S0421||GolfSpy| GolfSpy can obtain a list of installed applications.[17] |S0536||GPlayed| GPlayed can collect a list of installed applications.[18] |S0406||Gustuff| Gustuff checks for antivirus software contained in a predefined list.[19] |S0544||HenBox| HenBox can obtain a list of running apps.[20] |S0463||INSOMNIA| INSOMNIA can obtain a list of installed non-Apple applications.[21] |S0485||Mandrake| Mandrake can obtain a list of installed applications.[22] |S0407||Monokle| Monokle can list applications installed on the device.[23] |S0399||Pallas| Pallas retrieves a list of all applications installed on the device.[24] |S0316||Pegasus for Android| Pegasus for Android accesses the list of installed applications.[25] |S0539||Red Alert 2.0| Red Alert 2.0 can obtain the running application.[26] |S0403||Riltok| Riltok can retrieve a list of installed applications.

However, this technique may not be practical if many apps invoke these methods as part of their legitimate behavior. On iOS, application vetting techniques could similarly search for use of the private API call necessary to obtain a list of apps installed on the device. Additionally, on iOS, use of the private API call is likely to result in the app not being accepted into Apple's App Store.
