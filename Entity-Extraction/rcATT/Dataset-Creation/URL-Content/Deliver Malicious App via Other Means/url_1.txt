Malicious applications are a common attack vector used by adversaries to gain a presence on mobile devices. This technique describes installing a malicious application on targeted mobile devices without involving an authorized app store (e.g., Google Play Store or Apple App Store). Adversaries may wish to avoid placing malicious applications in an authorized app store due to increased potential risk of detection or other reasons. However, mobile devices often are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store which would prevent this technique from working. Delivery methods for the malicious application include: Some Android malware comes with functionality to install additional applications, either automatically or when the adversary instructs it to.[4] |ID||Name||Description| |S0440||Agent Smith| Agent Smith has been distributed through the 9apps app store.[5] |S0304||Android/Chuli.A| Android/Chuli.A was delivered via a spearphishing message containing a malicious Android application as an attachment.[6] |S0524||AndroidOS/MalLocker.B| AndroidOS/MalLocker.B has been spread using direct download links.

Users should be encouraged to not agree to installation of applications signed with enterprise distribution keys unless absolutely certain of the source of the application. On Android, the "Unknown Sources" setting must be enabled for users to install apps from sources other than an authorized app store (such as the Google Play Store), so users should be encouraged not to enable that setting.
