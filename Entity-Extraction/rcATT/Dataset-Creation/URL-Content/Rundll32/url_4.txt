Simple proof of concept and demonstration of RunDll32.exe limitations (a.k.a. "it's by design"). The solution consists of 3 components: - DLL - simple DLL exporting two methods, including "RunMe()" which is what you want to call, - PowerShell script calling the method you want, - cmd script with RunDLL32 trying to call the same method but effectively calling another one. DLL comes in C and in compiled version - your choice. The behavior you can observe is "by design", not very-well-known way of working of RunDll32: When you call Method() it tries to call MethodW() and MethodA() first instead of the one you asked. And the conclusion is "Luke, use the for^H^H^H PowerShell!"
