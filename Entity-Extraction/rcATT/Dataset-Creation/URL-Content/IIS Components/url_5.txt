Intercepting All Incoming IIS Requests Beginning with IIS 6.0, ISAPI extensions can intercept all incoming requests to an IIS server using the HSE_REQ_EXEC_URL function. This functionality is called wildcard application mapping. ISAPI extensions that implement this functionality are sometimes called global interceptors. Global interceptors can replace ISAPI filters that read raw data while supplying the added benefit of ISAPI extensions. A chain of global interceptors can be set up to redirect to one another or redirect out to another resource. IIS 5.1 and earlier: HSE_REQ_EXEC_URL is not available. Create an ISAPI filter to intercept incoming IIS requests. For more information about wildcard application mappings and alternatives for previous versions of IIS, see Wildcard Application Mapping. For another code example, see Remapping a URL Using a Wildcard Application Mapping.
