The mobile device may be targeted for exploitation through its interface to cellular networks or other radio interfaces. A message sent over a radio interface (typically cellular, but potentially Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, Wi-Fi[1] or other) to the mobile device could exploit a vulnerability in code running on the device[2][3]. An SMS message could contain content designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the SMS parser on the receiving device[4]. An SMS message could also contain a link to a web site containing malicious content designed to exploit the device web browser. Vulnerable SIM cards may be remotely exploited and reprogrammed via SMS messages[5]. |ID||Name||Description| |S0289||Pegasus for iOS| Pegasus for iOS was delivered via an SMS message containing a link to a web site with malicious code.[6] |ID||Mitigation||Description| |M1001||Security Updates| |M1006||Use Recent OS Version|
