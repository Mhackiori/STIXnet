A malicious application could capture sensitive data sent via SMS, including authentication credentials. SMS is frequently used to transmit codes used for multi-factor authentication. On Android, a malicious application must request and obtain permission (either at app install time or run time) in order to receive SMS messages. Alternatively, a malicious application could attempt to perform an operating system privilege escalation attack to bypass the permission requirement. On iOS, applications cannot access SMS messages in normal operation, so an adversary would need to attempt to perform an operating system privilege escalation attack to potentially be able to access SMS messages. |ID||Name||Description| |S0309||Adups| Adups transmitted the full contents of text messages.[1] |S0304||Android/Chuli.A| Android/Chuli.A stole SMS message content.[2] |S0292||AndroRAT| AndroRAT captures SMS messages.[3] |S0540||Asacub| Asacub can collect SMS messages as they are received.[4] |S0432||Bread| Bread can access SMS messages in order to complete carrier billing fraud.[5] |S0655||BusyGasper| BusyGasper can collect SMS messages.[6] |S0529||CarbonSteal| CarbonSteal can access the deviceâ€™s SMS and MMS messages.[7] |S0480||Cerberus| Cerberus can collect SMS messages from a device.[8] |S0425||Corona Updates| Corona Updates can collect SMS messages.[9] |S0301||Dendroid| Dendroid can intercept SMS messages.[10] |S0505||Desert Scorpion| Desert Scorpion can retrieve SMS messages.[11] |S0550||DoubleAgent| DoubleAgent has captured SMS and MMS messages.[7] |S0320||DroidJack| DroidJack captures SMS data.[12] |S0478||EventBot| EventBot can intercept SMS messages.[13] |S0522||Exobot| Exobot can intercept SMS messages.[14] |S0405||Exodus| Exodus Two can capture SMS messages.[15] |S0509||FakeSpy| FakeSpy can collect SMS messages.[16] |S0182||FinFisher| FinFisher captures and exfiltrates SMS messages.[17] |S0408||FlexiSpy| FlexiSpy can intercept SMS and MMS messages as well as monitor messages for keywords.[18][19] |S0577||FrozenCell| FrozenCell has read SMS messages for exfiltration.[20] |S0423||Ginp| Ginp can collect SMS messages.[21] |S0535||Golden Cup| Golden Cup can collect sent and received SMS messages.[22] |S0551||GoldenEagle| GoldenEagle has collected SMS messages.[7] |S0421||GolfSpy| GolfSpy can collect SMS messages.[23] |S0536||GPlayed| GPlayed can read SMS messages.[24] |S0406||Gustuff| Gustuff can intercept two-factor authentication codes transmitted via SMS.[25] |S0544||HenBox| HenBox can intercept SMS messages.[26] |S0463||INSOMNIA| INSOMNIA can retrieve SMS messages and iMessages.[27] |S0485||Mandrake| Mandrake can access SMS messages.[28] |S0303||MazarBOT| MazarBOT can intercept two-factor authentication codes sent by online banking apps.[29] |S0399||Pallas| Pallas captures and exfiltrates all SMS messages, including future messages as they are received.[17] |S0289||Pegasus for iOS| Pegasus for iOS captures SMS messages that the victim sends or receives.[30] |S0295||RCSAndroid| RCSAndroid can collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages.[31] |S0539||Red Alert 2.0| Red Alert 2.0 can collect SMS messages.[32] |S0403||Riltok| Riltok can intercept incoming SMS messages.[33] |S0411||Rotexy| Rotexy processes incoming SMS messages by filtering based on phone numbers, keywords, and regular expressions, focusing primarily on banks, payment systems, and mobile network operators.
