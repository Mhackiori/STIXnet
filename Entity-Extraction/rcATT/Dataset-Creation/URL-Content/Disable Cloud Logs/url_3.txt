This guide explains how to enable or disable some or all Data Access audit logs in your Cloud projects, billing accounts, folders, and organizations. Before you begin Before you proceed with configuring Data Access audit logs, understand the following information: Data Access audit logs—except for BigQuery—are disabled by default. If you want Data Access audit logs to be written for Google Cloud services other than BigQuery, you must explicitly enable them. Data Access audit logs help Google Support troubleshoot issues with your account. Therefore, we recommend enabling Data Access audit logs when possible. Admin Activity audit logs are enabled for all Google Cloud services and can't be configured. Configuration overview You can enable and configure certain aspects of Data Access audit logs for your Google Cloud resources and services: Organizations. You can enable and configure Data Access audit logs in an organization, which applies to all the existing and new Cloud projects and folders in the organization. Folders. You can enable and configure Data Access audit logs in a folder, which applies to all the existing and new Cloud projects in the folder. You can't disable a Data Access audit log that was enabled in the project's parent organization. Projects. You can configure Data Access audit logs for an individual Cloud project. You can't disable a Data Access audit log that was enabled in the project's parent organization or folder. Billing accounts. To configure Data Access audit logs for billing accounts, use the Google Cloud CLI. For more information about using the gcloudCLI with Data Access audit logs and billing accounts, see the gcloud beta billing accounts set-iam-policycommand reference documentation. Default configurations. You can specify a default Data Access audit log configuration in an organization, folder, or Cloud project that applies to future Google Cloud services that begin to produce Data Access audit logs. Services. You can specify the services whose audit logs you want to receive. For example, you might want audit logs from Compute Engine but not from Cloud SQL. For a list of the Google Cloud services that can generate audit logs, see Google services with audit logs. Operations. You can configure what types of operations are recorded in your Data Access audit logs. There are three types of operations that can be recorded: ADMIN_READ: Records operations that read metadata or configuration information. These operations can't be disabled. DATA_READ: Records operations that read user-provided data. DATA_WRITE: Records operations that write user-provided data. For example, Cloud DNS writes all three types of operations, but you could configure your Data Access audit logs to record only the DATA_WRITEoperations. Exempted users. You can exempt specific users or groups from having their data accesses recorded. For example, you can exempt your internal testing accounts from having their Cloud Debugger operations recorded. You can configure your Data Access audit logs through the IAM Audit Logs console or the API. These methods are explained in the sections below. Service-specific configurations If there is both a Google Cloud service-wide ( allServices) configuration and a configuration for a specific Google Cloud service, then the resulting configuration for the service is the union of the two configurations. In other words: You can enable Data Access audit logs for specific Google Cloud services, but you can't disable Data Access audit logs for Google Cloud services that are enabled in the broader configuration. You can add additional kinds of information to a Google Cloud service's Data Access audit log, but you can't remove kinds of information that are specified in the broader configuration. You can add users to exemption lists, but you can't remove users from exemption lists in the broader configuration. For BigQuery Data Transfer Service, Data Access audit log configuration is inherited from your default audit log configuration. Project, folder, and organization configurations You can configure Data Access audit logs for Cloud projects, folders, and organizations. If there is a configuration for a Google Cloud service across the hierarchy, then the resulting configuration is the union of the configurations. In other words, at the Cloud project level: You can enable logs for a Google Cloud service, but you can't disable logs for a Google Cloud service that is enabled in the folder or organization. You can enable kinds of information, but you can't disable kinds of information that are enabled in the organization or folder. You can add users to exemption lists, but you can't remove users that are on the organization's or folder's exemption lists. At the organization or folder level, you can enable Data Access audit logs for a Cloud project within that organization or folder, even if Data Access audit logs haven't been configured in the Cloud project. Access control Identity and Access Management roles and permissions govern access to Logging data, including viewing and managing the IAM policies underlying Data Access audit logging configurations. To view or set the policies associated with Data Access configuration, you need a role with permissions at the appropriate resource level. For instructions on granting these resource-level roles, see Manage access to Cloud projects, folders, and organizations. To set IAM policies, you need a role with the resourcemanager.RESOURCE_TYPE.setIamPolicypermission. To view IAM policies, you need a role with the resourcemanager.RESOURCE_TYPE.getIamPolicypermission. For the list of the permissions and roles you need to view Data Access audit logs, see the Logging access control guide. Configure Data Access audit logs with the Cloud Console This section explains how to use the Cloud Console to configure Data Access audit logs. You can also use the API or the Google Cloud CLI to perform these tasks programmatically; see Configuring Data Access audit logs with the API for details. To access audit log configuration options in the Cloud Console, follow these steps: From the Cloud Console, select IAM & Admin > Audit Logs: Go to the Audit Logs page Select an existing Cloud project, folder, or organization at the top of the page. Enable audit logs The following steps show you how to enable Data Access audit logs: In the main table on the Audit Logs page, select one or more Google Cloud services from the Title column. In the Log Type tab, select the boxes by the Data Access audit log types that you wish to enable and then click Save. Where you have successfully enabled audit logs, the table includes a checkmark. In the following example, you see that, for the Cloud Composer API service, Admin Read and Data Read audit logs are enabled: You can also enable audit logs for all Google Cloud services that produce Data Access audit logs. In the main table on the Audit Logs page, select all Google Cloud services. Note that this bulk configuration method applies only to the Google Cloud services that are currently available. If a new Google Cloud service is added, it inherits your default audit configuration. Disable Data Access audit logs The following steps show you how to disable Data Access audit logs: In the main table on the Audit Logs page, select one or more Google Cloud services. In the Log Type tab, select the Data Access audit log types that you want to disable and then click Save. Where you've successfully disabled Data Access audit logs, the table indicates this with a gray dash. Any enabled Data Access audit logs are indicated with a green checkmark. Set user exemptions You can set exemptions to let you control which users generate audit logs. When you add an exempted user, audit logs aren't created for that user for the selected log types. Note that Admin Activity logs are always generated regardless of exemption status. The following steps show you how to set exemptions: In the main table on the Audit Logs configuration page, select one or more Google Cloud services from the Title column. Select the Exempted Users tab. In Add exempted user, write the email address of the user that you want add to the exemption list for your selected services. You can add multiple users by selecting the Add exempted user button as many times as needed. Select the boxes by the Data Access audit log types that you wish to disable for the user and then click Save. Where you have successfully added exempted users to a service, the table indicates this with a number under the Exemptions column. To remove a user from your exemption list: Go to the Exempted Users tab in the information panel. Hover over a user name and select the trash icon that appears. Once the user's name is shown in strikethrough text, click Save. To edit the information for an exempted user: Go to the Exempted Users tab in the information panel. Click the expander arrow to the right of the user name. Select or de-select the Data Access audit log types as appropriate for the user and then click Save. Set the default configuration You can set a configuration that all new and existing Google Cloud services in your Cloud project, folder, or organization inherit. Setting this default configuration applies if a new Google Cloud service becomes available and users in your organization begin using it: the service inherits the audit logging policy that you have already set for other Google Cloud services, ensuring that Data Access audit logs are captured. Click on Set Default Configuration at the top of the page. In the Log Type tab, select the boxes by the Data Access audit log types that you wish to enable or disable, and then click Save. In the Exempted Users tab, write the email address of the users that you wish add to the exemption list and then click Save. Follow the steps in the Set user exemptions section above. Configure Data Access audit logs with the API This section explains how to use the API and the gcloud CLI to configure Data Access audit logs programmatically. Many of these tasks can also be performed by using the Cloud Console; see Configuring Data Access audit logs with the Cloud Console for details. IAM policy objects To configure Data Access audit logs using the API, you must edit the IAM policy associated with your Cloud project, folder, or organization. The audit log configuration is in the auditConfigs section of the policy: "auditConfigs": [ { object(AuditConfig) } ] For details, see the IAM Policy type. The following sections describe the AuditConfig object in more detail. For the API and gcloud CLI commands used to change the configuration, see getIamPolicy and setIamPolicy AuditConfig objects The audit log configuration consists of a list of AuditConfig objects. Each object configures the logs for one service, or it establishes a broader configuration for all services. Each object looks like the following: { "service": SERVICE, "auditLogConfigs": [ { "logType": "ADMIN_READ" "exemptedMembers": [ PRINCIPAL,] }, { "logType": "DATA_READ" "exemptedMembers": [ PRINCIPAL,] }, { "logType": "DATA_WRITE" "exemptedMembers": [ PRINCIPAL,] }, ] }, SERVICE is service name such as "appengine.googleapis.com", or it is the special value, "allServices". If a configuration doesn't mention a particular service, then the broader configuration is used for that service. If there is no configuration, then Data Access audit logs aren't enabled for that service. For a list of the service names, see Log services. The auditLogConfigs section of the AuditConfig object is a list of 0 to 3 objects, each of which configures one kind of audit log information. If you omit one of the kinds from the list, then that kind of information isn't enabled for the service. PRINCIPAL is a user for whom Data Access audit logs isn't collected. You can specify single users, groups, or service accounts. The Binding type describes different kinds of principals, but not all of those can be used to configure Data Access audit logs. Following is an example of an audit configuration in both JSON and YAML formats. The YAML format is the default when using the Google Cloud CLI. JSON "auditConfigs": [ { "auditLogConfigs": [ { "logType": "ADMIN_READ" }, { "logType": "DATA_WRITE" }, { "logType": "DATA_READ" } ], "service": "allServices" }, { "auditLogConfigs": [ { "exemptedMembers": [ "499862534253-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" ], "logType": "ADMIN_READ" } ], "service": "cloudsql.googleapis.com" } ], YAML auditConfigs: - auditLogConfigs: - logType: ADMIN_READ - logType: DATA_WRITE - logType: DATA_READ service: allServices - auditLogConfigs: - exemptedMembers: - 499862534253-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com logType: ADMIN_READ service: cloudsql.googleapis.com Common configurations Following are some common audit log configurations for Cloud projects. These configurations don't include any audit log configuration in the project's organization or folder. For more information, see Organization and Cloud project configurations. Enable all Data Access audit logs The following auditConfigs section enables Data Access audit logs for all services and users: JSON "auditConfigs": [ { "service": "allServices", "auditLogConfigs": [ { "logType": "ADMIN_READ" }, { "logType": "DATA_READ" }, { "logType": "DATA_WRITE" }, ] }, ] YAML auditConfigs: - auditLogConfigs: - logType: ADMIN_READ - logType: DATA_WRITE - logType: DATA_READ service: allServices Enable one service and information kind The following configuration enables Data Access audit logs for Cloud SQL. The logs record only the writes of user-defined data: JSON "auditConfigs": [ { "service": "cloudsql.googleapis.com", "auditLogConfigs": [ { "logType": "DATA_WRITE" }, ] }, ] YAML auditConfigs: - auditLogConfigs: - logType: DATA_WRITE service: cloudsql.googleapis.com Disable all Data Access audit logs To disable all Data Access audit logs (except BigQuery) in a Cloud project, include an empty auditConfigs: section in your new IAM policy: JSON "auditConfigs": [], YAML auditConfigs: If you remove the auditConfigs section entirely from your new policy, then setIamPolicy doesn't change the existing Data Access audit logs configuration. For more information, see The setIamPolicy update mask. BigQuery Data Access audit logs can't be disabled. getIamPolicy and setIamPolicy You use the Resource Manager API getIamPolicy and setIamPolicy methods to read and write your IAM policy. You have several choices for the specific methods to use: The Resource Manager API has the following methods: projects.getIamPolicy projects.setIamPolicy organizations.getIamPolicy organizations.setIamPolicy The Google Cloud CLI has the following Resource Manager commands: gcloud projects get-iam-policy gcloud projects set-iam-policy gcloud resource-manager folders get-iam-policy gcloud resource-manager folders set-iam-policy gcloud organizations get-iam-policy gcloud organizations set-iam-policy gcloud beta billing accounts get-iam-policy gcloud beta billing accounts set-iam-policy Regardless of your choice, follow these three steps: - Read the current policy using one of the getIamPolicymethods. Save the policy to a temporary file. - Edit the policy in the temporary file. Change (or add) only the auditConfigssection. - Write the edited policy in the temporary file, using one of the setIamPolicymethods. setIamPolicy fails if Resource Manager detects that someone else changed the policy after you read it in the first step. If this happens, then repeat the three steps. Examples The following examples demonstrate how to configure your project's Data Access audit logs using the gcloud command and the Resource Manager API. To configure organization Data Access audit logs, replace the "projects" version of the commands and API methods with the "organizations" version. gcloud To configure your Data Access audit logs using the gcloud projects command, do the following: Read your project's IAM policy and store it in a file: gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID > /tmp/policy.yaml The returned policy is shown below. This policy doesn't yet have an auditConfigssection: bindings: - members: - user:colleague@example.com role: roles/editor - members: - user:myself@example.com role: roles/owner etag: BwVM-FDzeYM= version: 1 Edit your policy in /tmp/policy.yaml, adding or changing only the Data Access audit logs configuration. An example of your edited policy, which enables Cloud SQL data-write Data Access audit logs, is shown below. Four lines have been added to the beginning: auditConfigs: - auditLogConfigs: - logType: DATA_WRITE service: cloudsql.googleapis.com bindings: - members: - user:colleague@example.com role: roles/editor - members: - user:myself@example.com role: roles/owner etag: BwVM-FDzeYM= version: 1 Write your new IAM policy: gcloud projects set-iam-policy PROJECT_ID /tmp/policy.yaml If the preceding command reports a conflict with another change, then repeat these steps, starting with the first step. JSON To work with your IAM policy in JSON format instead of YAML, substitute the following gcloud commands into the example: gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID --format=json >/tmp/policy.json gcloud projects set-iam-policy PROJECT_ID /tmp/policy.json API To configure your Data Access audit logs using the Resource Manager API, do the following: Read your project's IAM policy, specifying the following parameters to the getIamPolicy API method: - resource: projects/PROJECT_ID - Request body: empty The method returns the current policy object, shown below. This project's policy doesn't yet have an auditConfigssection: { "bindings": [ { "members": [ "user:colleague@example.com" ], "role": "roles/editor" }, { "members": [ "user:myself@example.com" ], "role": "roles/owner" } ], "etag": "BwUsv2gimRs=", "version": 1 Edit the current policy: Change or add the auditConfigssection. To disable your Data Access audit logs, include an empty value for the section: auditConfigs:[]. Preserve the value of etag. You can also remove all other information from the new policy object, as long as you're careful to set updateMaskin the next step. The edited policy, which enables Cloud SQL data-write audit logs, is shown below: { "auditConfigs": [ { "auditLogConfigs": [ { "logType": "DATA_WRITE" } ], "service": "cloudsql.googleapis.com" } ], "etag": "BwVM-FDzeYM=" } Write the new policy using the setIamPolicy API method, specifying the following parameters: - resource: projects/PROJECT_ID - Request body: - updateMask: "auditConfigs,etag" - policy: your edited policy object The setIamPolicy update mask This section explains the importance of the updateMask parameter in the setIamPolicy method, and explains why you must be careful with the gcloud CLI set-iam-policy command so that you don't cause accidental harm to your Cloud project or organization. The setIamPolicy API method uses an updateMask parameter to control which policy fields are updated. For example, if the mask does not contain bindings, then you can't accidentally change that policy section. On the other hand, if the mask does contain bindings, then that section is always updated. If you don't include an updated value for bindings, then that section is removed entirely from the policy. The gcloud projects set-iam-policy command, which calls setIamPolicy, doesn't let you specify the updateMask parameter. Instead, the command computes a value for updateMask in the following way: - The updateMaskalways contains the fields bindingsand etag. - If the policy object supplied in set-iam-policycontains any other top-level fields—such as auditConfigs—then those fields are added to updateMask. As a consequence of these rules, the set-iam-policy command has the following behaviors: If you omit the auditConfigssection in your new policy, then the previous value of auditConfigssection (if any) isn't changed, because that section isn't in the update mask. This is harmless but might be confusing. If you omit bindingsin your new policy object, then the bindingssection is removed from your policy, since this section appears in the update mask. This is very harmful, and causes all users to lose access to your Cloud project. If you omit etagin your new policy object, this disables the checking for concurrent changes to your policy and might result in your changes accidentally overwriting someone else's changes.
