Managed Object Format (MOF) Managed Object Format (MOF) is the language used to describe Common Information Model (CIM) classes. The recommended way for WMI providers to implement new WMI classes is in MOF files which are compiled using Mofcomp.exe into the WMI repository. It is also possible to create and manipulate CIM classes and instances using the COM API for WMI. A WMI provider normally consists of a MOF file, which defines the data and event classes for which the provider returns data, and a DLL file which contains the code that supplies data. For more information, see Providing Data to WMI. WMI client scripts and applications can query for instances of provider MOF classes or subscribe to receive event notifications. You can perform the following tasks with MOF: - Compiling MOF Files - Creating a Class - Creating an Instance - Creating a Method - Adding a Qualifier - Creating a Comment Related topics
