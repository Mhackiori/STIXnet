Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow The OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant can be used in apps that are installed on a device to gain access to protected resources, such as web APIs. Using the Microsoft identity platform implementation of OAuth 2.0 and Open ID Connect (OIDC), you can add sign in and API access to your mobile and desktop apps. This article describes how to program directly against the protocol in your application using any language. When possible, we recommend you use the supported Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) to acquire tokens and call secured web APIs. For more information, look at sample apps that use MSAL. The OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow is described in section 4.1 of the OAuth 2.0 specification. With OIDC, this flow does authentication and authorization for most app types. These types include single page apps, web apps, and natively installed apps. The flow enables apps to securely acquire an access_token that can be used to access resources secured by the Microsoft identity platform. Apps can refresh tokens to get other access tokens and ID tokens for the signed in user. Protocol diagram This diagram provides a high-level overview of the authentication flow for an application: Redirect URI setup required for single-page apps The authorization code flow for single page applications requires additional setup. Follow the instructions for creating your single-page application to correctly mark your redirect URI as enabled for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). To update an existing redirect URI to enable CORS, open the manifest editor and set the type field for your redirect URI to spa in the replyUrlsWithType section. Or, you can select the redirect URI in Authentication > Web and select URIs to migrate to using the authorization code flow. The spa redirect type is backwards compatible with the implicit flow. Apps currently using the implicit flow to get tokens can move to the spa redirect URI type without issues and continue using the implicit flow. If you attempt to use the authorization code flow without setting up CORS for your redirect URI, you will see this error in the console: access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0/oauth2/token' from origin 'yourApp.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If so, visit your app registration and update the redirect URI for your app to use the spa type. Applications can't use a spa redirect URI with non-SPA flows, for example, native applications or client credential flows. To ensure security and best practices, the Microsoft identity platform returns an error if you attempt to use a spa redirect URI without an Origin header. Similarly, the Microsoft identity platform also prevents the use of client credentials in all flows in the presence of an Origin header, to ensure that secrets aren't used from within the browser. Request an authorization code The authorization code flow begins with the client directing the user to the /authorize endpoint. In this request, the client requests the openid, offline_access, and https://graph.microsoft.com/mail.read permissions from the user. Some permissions are admin-restricted, for example, writing data to an organization's directory by using Directory.ReadWrite.All. If your application requests access to one of these permissions from an organizational user, the user receives an error message that says they're not authorized to consent to your app's permissions. To request access to admin-restricted scopes, you should request them directly from a Global Administrator. For more information, see Admin-restricted permissions. // Line breaks for legibility only https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize? client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e &response_type=code &redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F &response_mode=query &scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fmail.read%20api%3A%2F%2F &state=12345 &code_challenge=YTFjNjI1OWYzMzA3MTI4ZDY2Njg5M2RkNmVjNDE5YmEyZGRhOGYyM2IzNjdmZWFhMTQ1ODg3NDcxY2Nl &code_challenge_method=S256 Tip Select the link below to execute this request!

For more information, see Permissions and consent in the Microsoft identity platform. Once the user authenticates and grants consent, the Microsoft identity platform returns a response to your app at the indicated redirect_uri, using the method specified in the response_mode parameter.

Retry the request without | Request an ID token as well or hybrid flow To learn who the user is before redeeming an authorization code, it's common for applications to also request an ID token when they request the authorization code. This approach is called the hybrid flow because it mixes the implicit grant with the authorization code flow. The hybrid flow is commonly used in web apps to render a page for a user without blocking on code redemption, notably in ASP.NET. Both single-page apps and traditional web apps benefit from reduced latency in this model. The hybrid flow is the same as the authorization code flow described earlier but with three additions. All of these additions are required to request an ID token: new scopes, a new response_type, and a new nonce query parameter. // Line breaks for legibility only https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize? client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e &response_type=code%20id_token &redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F &response_mode=fragment &scope=openid%20offline_access%20https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fuser.read &state=12345 &nonce=abcde &code_challenge=YTFjNjI1OWYzMzA3MTI4ZDY2Njg5M2RkNmVjNDE5YmEyZGRhOGYyM2IzNjdmZWFhMTQ1ODg3NDcxY2Nl &code_challenge_method=S256 |Updated Parameter||Required/optional||Description| |required||The addition of | |required||For ID tokens, this parameter must be updated to include the ID token scopes: | |required||A value included in the request, generated by the app, that is included in the resulting | |recommended||Specifies the method that should be used to send the resulting token back to your app. Default value is | The use of fragment as a response mode causes issues for web apps that read the code from the redirect.

Symmetric shared secrets are generated by the Microsoft identity platform. Certificate credentials are asymmetric keys uploaded by the developer. For more information, see Microsoft identity platform application authentication certificate credentials. For best security, we recommend using certificate credentials. Public clients, which include native applications and single page apps, must not use secrets or certificates when redeeming an authorization code. Always ensure that your redirect URIs include the type of application and are unique.

This indicates that the redirect URI used to request the token has not been marked as a spa redirect URI. Review the application registration steps on how to enable this flow. Use the access token Now that you've successfully acquired an access_token, you can use the token in requests to web APIs by including it in the Authorization header: GET /v1.0/me/messages Host: https://graph.microsoft.com Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q... Refresh the access token Access tokens are short lived. Refresh them after they expire to continue accessing resources. You can do so by submitting another POST request to the /token endpoint. Provide the refresh_token instead of the code. Refresh tokens are valid for all permissions that your client has already received consent for. For example, a refresh token issued on a request for scope=mail.read can be used to request a new access token for scope=api://contoso.com/api/UseResource. Refresh tokens for web apps and native apps don't have specified lifetimes. Typically, the lifetimes of refresh tokens are relatively long. However, in some cases, refresh tokens expire, are revoked, or lack sufficient privileges for the action. Your application needs to expect and handle errors returned by the token issuance endpoint. Single page apps get a token with a 24-hour lifetime, requiring a new authentication every day. This action can be done silently in an iframe when third-party cookies are enabled. It must be done in a top-level frame, either full page navigation or a pop-up window, in browsers without third-party cookies, such as Safari. Refresh tokens aren't revoked when used to acquire new access tokens. You're expected to discard the old refresh token. The OAuth 2.0 spec says: "The authorization server MAY issue a new refresh token, in which case the client MUST discard the old refresh token and replace it with the new refresh token. The authorization server MAY revoke the old refresh token after issuing a new refresh token to the client." Important For refresh tokens sent to a redirect URI registered as spa, the refresh token expires after 24 hours. Additional refresh tokens acquired using the initial refresh token carries over that expiration time, so apps must be prepared to re-run the authorization code flow using an interactive authentication to get a new refresh token every 24 hours. Users do not have to enter their credentials, and usually don't even see any user experience, just a reload of your application. The browser must visit the login page in a top level frame in order to see the login session. This is due to privacy features in browsers that block third party cookies. // Line breaks for legibility only POST /{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1 Host: https://login.microsoftonline.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded client_id=535fb089-9ff3-47b6-9bfb-4f1264799865 &scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fmail.read &refresh_token=OAAABAAAAiL9Kn2Z27UubvWFPbm0gLWQJVzCTE9UkP3pSx1aXxUjq... &grant_type=refresh_token &client_secret=sampleCredentia1s // NOTE: Only required for web apps.
