Clear-Event Log Clears all entries from specified event logs on the local or remote computers. Syntax Clear-Event Log [-LogName] <String[]> [[-ComputerName] <String[]>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>] Description The Clear-EventLog cmdlet deletes all of the entries from the specified event logs on the local computer or on remote computers. To use Clear-EventLog, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the affected computer. The cmdlets that contain the EventLog noun (the EventLog cmdlets) work only on classic event logs. To get events from logs that use the Windows Event Log technology in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, use the Get-WinEvent cmdlet. Examples Example 1: Clear specific event log types from the local computer Clear-EventLog "Windows PowerShell" This command clears the entries from the Windows PowerShell event log on the local computer. Example 2: Clear specific multiple log types from the local and remote computers Clear-EventLog -LogName ODiag, OSession -ComputerName localhost, Server02 This command clears all of the entries in the Microsoft Office Diagnostics (ODiag) and Microsoft Office Sessions (OSession) logs on the local computer and the Server02 remote computer. Example 3: Clear all logs on the specified computers then display the event log list Clear-EventLog -LogName application, system -confirm This command prompts you for confirmation before deleting the entries in the specified event logs. Example 4: Clear all logs on the specified computers then display the event log list function clear-all-event-logs ($computerName="localhost") { $logs = Get-EventLog -ComputerName $computername -List | ForEach-Object {$_.Log} $logs | ForEach-Object {Clear-EventLog -ComputerName $computername -LogName $_ } Get-EventLog -ComputerName $computername -list } clear-all-event-logs -ComputerName Server01 Max(K) Retain OverflowAction Entries Log ------ ------ -------------- ------- --- 15,168 0 OverwriteAsNeeded 0 Application 15,168 0 OverwriteAsNeeded 0 DFS Replication 512 7 OverwriteOlder 0 DxStudio 20,480 0 OverwriteAsNeeded 0 Hardware Events 512 7 OverwriteOlder 0 Internet Explorer 20,480 0 OverwriteAsNeeded 0 Key Management Service 16,384 0 OverwriteAsNeeded 0 Microsoft Office Diagnostics 16,384 0 OverwriteAsNeeded 0 Microsoft Office Sessions 30,016 0 OverwriteAsNeeded 1 Security 15,168 0 OverwriteAsNeeded 2 System 15,360 0 OverwriteAsNeeded 0 Windows PowerShell This function clears all event logs on the specified computers and then displays the resulting event log list. Notice that a few entries were added to the System and Security logs after the logs were cleared but before they were displayed. Parameters Specifies a remote computer. The default is the local computer. Type the NetBIOS name, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, or a fully qualified domain name of a remote computer. To specify the local computer, type the computer name, a dot (.), or "localhost". This parameter does not rely on Windows PowerShell remoting. You can use the ComputerName parameter of Get-EventLog even if your computer is not configured to run remote commands. |Type:||String[]| |Aliases:||Cn| |Position:||1| |Default value:||Local computer| |Accept pipeline input:||True| |Accept wildcard characters:||False| Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet. |Type:||SwitchParameter| |Aliases:||cf| |Position:||Named| |Default value:||False| |Accept pipeline input:||False| |Accept wildcard characters:||False| Specifies the event logs. Enter the log name (the value of the Log property not the LogDisplayName) of one or more event logs, separated by commas. Wildcard characters are not permitted. This parameter is required. Important This parameter is supposed to accept values from the pipeline by property name. However, there is a bug that prevents this from working. You must pass a value using the parameter directly. |Type:||String[]| |Aliases:||LN| |Position:||0| |Default value:||None| |Accept pipeline input:||True| |Accept wildcard characters:||False| Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet is not run. |Type:||SwitchParameter| |Aliases:||wi| |Position:||Named| |Default value:||False| |Accept pipeline input:||False| |Accept wildcard characters:||False| Inputs None You cannot pipe objects to Clear-EventLog. Outputs None This cmdlet does not generate any output. Notes - To use Clear-EventLogon Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, start Windows PowerShell with the "Run as administrator" option.
