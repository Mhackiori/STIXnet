Introduction A subtle but significant difference between the Win32 API and the Native API (see Inside the Native API for more information on this largely undocumented interface) is the way that names are described. In the Win32 API strings are interpreted as NULL-terminated ANSI (8-bit) or wide character (16-bit) strings. In the Native API names are counted Unicode (16-bit) strings. While this distinction is usually not important, it leaves open an interesting situation: there is a class of names that can be referenced using the Native API, but that cannot be described using the Win32 API.
